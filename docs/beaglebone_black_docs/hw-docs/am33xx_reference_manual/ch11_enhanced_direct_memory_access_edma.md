# 11 Enhanced Direct Memory Access (EDMA)



This chapter describes the EDMA of the device.



## 11.1 Introduction

The enhanced direct memory access (EDMA3) controller’s primary purpose is to service user-
programmed data transfers between two memory-mapped slave endpoints on the device.
Typical usage includes, but is not limited to the following:
• Servicing software-driven paging transfers (e.g., transfers from external memory, such as DDR2 to
internal device memory).
• Servicing event-driven peripherals, such as a serial port.
• Performing sorting or sub-frame extraction of various data structures.
• Offloading data transfers from the main device CPU(s).
The EDMA3 controller consists of two principal blocks:
• EDMA3 channel controller (EDMA3CC).
• EDMA3 transfer controller(s) (EDMA3TC).
The EDMA3 channel controller serves as the user interface for the EDMA3 controller. The EDMA3CC
includes parameter RAM (PaRAM), channel control registers, and interrupt control registers. The
EDMA3CC serves to prioritize incoming software requests or events from peripherals and submits transfer
requests (TRs) to the transfer controller.
The EDMA3 transfer controllers are slaves to the EDMA3 channel controller that is responsible for data
movement. The transfer controller issues read/write commands to the source and destination addresses
that are programmed for a given transfer. The operation is transparent to user.

## 11.3 Functional Description

This chapter discusses the architecture of the EDMA3 controller.


### 11.3.1 Functional Overview


#### 11.3.1.1 EDMA3 Channel Controller (EDMA3CC)

Figure 11-2 shows a functional block diagram of the EDMA3 channel controller (EDMA3CC).
The main blocks of the EDMA3CC are as follows:
• Parameter RAM (PaRAM): The PaRAM maintains parameter sets for channel and reload parameter
sets. You must write the PaRAM with the transfer context for the desired channels and link parameter
sets. EDMA3CC processes sets based on a trigger event and submits a transfer request (TR) to the
transfer controller.
• EDMA3 event and interrupt processing registers: Allows mapping of events to parameter sets,
enable/disable events, enable/disable interrupt conditions, and clearing interrupts.
• Completion detection: The completion detect block detects completion of transfers by the EDMA3TC
and/or slave peripherals. You can optionally use completion of transfers to chain trigger new transfers
or to assert interrupts.
• Event queues: Event queues form the interface between the event detection logic and the transfer
request submission logic.
• Memory protection registers: Memory protection registers define the accesses (privilege level and
requestor(s)) that are allowed to access the DMA channel shadow region view(s) and regions of
PaRAM.
Other functions include the following:
• Region registers: Region registers allow DMA resources (DMA channels and interrupts) to be assigned
to unique regions that different EDMA3 programmers own (for example, ARM).
• Debug registers: Debug registers allow debug visibility by providing registers to read the queue status,
controller status, and missed event status.
The EDMA3CC includes two channel types: DMA channels (64 channels) and QDMA channels (8
channels).
Each channel is associated with a given event queue/transfer controller and with a given PaRAM set. The
main thing that differentiates a DMA channel from a QDMA channel is the method that the system uses to
trigger transfers. See Section 11.3.4.

A trigger event is needed to initiate a transfer. A trigger event may be due to an external event, manual
write to the event set register, or chained event for DMA channels. QDMA channels auto-trigger when a
write to the trigger word that you program occurs on the associated PaRAM set. All such trigger events
are logged into appropriate registers upon recognition.
Once a trigger event is recognized, the appropriate event gets queued in the EDMA3CC event queue. The
assignment of each DMA/QDMA channel to an event queue is programmable. Each queue is 16 events
deep; therefore, you can queue up to 16 events (on a single queue) in the EDMA3CC at a time. Additional
pending events that are mapped to a full queue are queued when the event queue space becomes
available. See Section 11.3.11.
If events on different channels are detected simultaneously, the events are queued based on a fixed
priority arbitration scheme with the DMA channels being higher priority events than the QDMA channels.
Among the two groups of channels, the lowest-numbered channel is the highest priority.


Each event in the event queue is processed in FIFO order. When the head of the queue is reached, the
PaRAM associated with that channel is read to determine the transfer details. The TR submission logic
evaluates the validity of the TR and is responsible for submitting a valid transfer request (TR) to the
appropriate EDMA3TC (based on the event queue to the EDMA3TC association, Q0 goes to TC0 , Q1
goes to TC1, and Q2 goes to TC2). For more information, refer to Section 11.3.3.
The EDMA3TC receives the request and is responsible for data movement, as specified in the transfer
request packet (TRP), other necessary tasks like buffering, and ensuring transfers are carried out in an
optimal fashion wherever possible. For more information on EDMA3TC, refer to Section 11.3.1.2.
If you have decided to receive an interrupt or to chain to another channel on completion of the current
transfer, the EDMA3TC signals completion to the EDMA3CC completion detection logic when the transfer
is complete. You can alternately choose to trigger completion when a TR leaves the EDMA3CC boundary,
rather than wait for all of the data transfers to complete. Based on the setting of the EDMA3CC interrupt
registers, the completion interrupt generation logic is responsible for generating EDMA3CC completion
interrupts to the CPU. For more information, refer to Section 11.3.5.
Additionally, the EDMA3CC also has an error detection logic that causes an error interrupt generation on
various error conditions (like missed events, exceeding event queue thresholds, etc.). For more

The main blocks of the EDMA3TC are:
• DMA program register set: The DMA program register set stores the transfer requests received from
the EDMA3 channel controller (EDMA3CC).
• DMA source active register set: The DMA source active register set stores the context for the DMA
transfer request currently in progress in the read controller.
• Read controller: The read controller issues read commands to the source address.
• Destination FIFO register set: The destination (DST) FIFO register set stores the context for the DMA
transfer request(s) currently in progress in the write controller.
• Write controller: The write controller issues write commands/write data to the destination slave.
• Data FIFO: The data FIFO exists for holding temporary in-flight data.
• Completion interface: The completion interface sends completion codes to the EDMA3CC when a
transfer completes, and generates interrupts and chained events (also, see Section 11.3.1.1 for more
information on transfer completion reporting).


When the EDMA3TC is idle and receives its first TR, DMA program register set receives the TR, where it
transitions to the DMA source active set and the destination FIFO register set immediately. The second
TR (if pending from EDMA3CC) is loaded into the DMA program set, ensuring it can start as soon as
possible when the active transfer completes. As soon as the current active set is exhausted, the TR is
loaded from the DMA program register set into the DMA source active register set as well as to the
appropriate entry in the destination FIFO register set.
The read controller issues read commands governed by the rules of command fragmentation and
optimization. These are issued only when the data FIFO has space available for the data read. When
sufficient data is in the data FIFO, the write controller starts issuing a write command again following the
rules for command fragmentation and optimization. For more information on command fragmentation and
optimization, refer to Section 11.3.12.1.1.
Depending on the number of entries, the read controller can process up to two or four transfer requests
ahead of the destination subject to the amount of free data FIFO.


### 11.3.2 Types of EDMA3 Transfers

An EDMA3 transfer is always defined in terms of three dimensions. Figure 11-4 shows the three
dimensions used by EDMA3 transfers. These three dimensions are defined as:
• 1st Dimension or Array (A): The 1st dimension in a transfer consists of ACNT contiguous bytes.
• 2nd Dimension or Frame (B): The 2nd dimension in a transfer consists of BCNT arrays of ACNT bytes.
Each array transfer in the 2nd dimension is separated from each other by an index programmed using
SRCBIDX or DSTBIDX.
• 3rd Dimension or Block (C): The 3rd dimension in a transfer consists of CCNT frames of BCNT arrays
of ACNT bytes. Each transfer in the 3rd dimension is separated from the previous by an index
programmed using SRCCIDX or DSTCIDX.
Note that the reference point for the index depends on the synchronization type. The amount of data
transferred upon receipt of a trigger/synchronization event is controlled by the synchronization types
(SYNCDIM bit in OPT). Of the three dimensions, only two synchronization types are supported: A-
synchronized transfers and AB-synchronized transfers.

#### 11.3.2.1 A-Synchronized Transfers

In an A-synchronized transfer, each EDMA3 sync event initiates the transfer of the 1st dimension of ACNT
bytes, or one array of ACNT bytes. In other words, each event/TR packet conveys the transfer information
for one array only. Thus, BCNT × CCNT events are needed to completely service a PaRAM set.
Arrays are always separated by SRCBIDX and DSTBIDX, as shown in Figure 11-5, where the start
address of Array N is equal to the start address of Array N – 1 plus source (SRC) or destination (DST)
BIDX.
Frames are always separated by SRCCIDX and DSTCIDX. For A-synchronized transfers, after the frame
is exhausted, the address is updated by adding SRCCIDX/DSTCIDX to the beginning address of the last
array in the frame. As in Figure 11-5, SRCCIDX/DSTCIDX is the difference between the start of Frame 0
Array 3 to the start of Frame 1 Array 0.
Figure 11-5 shows an A-synchronized transfer of 3 (CCNT) frames of 4 (BCNT) arrays of n (ACNT) bytes.
In this example, a total of 12 sync events (BCNT × CCNT) exhaust a PaRAM set. See Section 11.3.3.6 for
details on parameter set updates.

#### 11.3.2.2 AB-Synchronized Transfers

In a AB-synchronized transfer, each EDMA3 sync event initiates the transfer of 2 dimensions or one
frame. In other words, each event/TR packet conveys information for one entire frame of BCNT arrays of
ACNT bytes. Thus, CCNT events are needed to completely service a PaRAM set.
Arrays are always separated by SRCBIDX and DSTBIDX as shown in Figure 11-6. Frames are always
separated by SRCCIDX and DSTCIDX.
Note that for AB-synchronized transfers, after a TR for the frame is submitted, the address update is to
add SRCCIDX/DSTCIDX to the beginning address of the beginning array in the frame. This is different
from A-synchronized transfers where the address is updated by adding SRCCIDX/DSTCIDX to the start
address of the last array in the frame. See Section 11.3.3.6 for details on parameter set updates.
Figure 11-6 shows an AB-synchronized transfer of 3 (CCNT) frames of 4 (BCNT) arrays of n (ACNT)
bytes. In this example, a total of 3 sync events (CCNT) exhaust a PaRAM set; that is, a total of 3 transfers
of 4 arrays each completes the transfer.

NOTE: ABC-synchronized transfers are not directly supported. But can be logically achieved by
chaining between multiple AB-synchronized transfers.


### 11.3.3 Parameter RAM (PaRAM)

The EDMA3 controller is a RAM-based architecture. The transfer context (source/destination addresses,
count, indexes, etc.) for DMA or QDMA channels is programmed in a parameter RAM table within
EDMA3CC, referred to as PaRAM. The PaRAM table is segmented into multiple PaRAM sets. Each
PaRAM set includes eight four-byte PaRAM set entries (32-bytes total per PaRAM set), which includes
typical DMA transfer parameters such as source address, destination address, transfer counts, indexes,
options, etc.
The PaRAM structure supports flexible ping-pong, circular buffering, channel chaining, and auto-reloading
(linking).
The contents of the PaRAM include the following:
• 256 PaRAM sets
• 64 channels that are direct mapped and can be used as link or QDMA sets if not used for DMA
channels
• 64 channels remain for link or QDMA sets


By default, all channels map to PaRAM set to 0. These should be remapped before use. For more
information, see (DCHMAP registers) and (QCHMAP registers).

#### 11.3.3.1 PaRAM

Each parameter set of PaRAM is organized into eight 32-bit words or 32 bytes, as shown in Figure 11-7
and described in Table 11-6. Each PaRAM set consists of 16-bit and 32-bit parameters.

not supported and attempts to do so may result in undefined
behavior.
(1)
If OPT, SRC, or DST is the trigger word for a QDMA transfer, then doing a 32-bit access is required for that field. TI also recommends
performing only 32-bit accesses on the parameter RAM for best code compatibility. For example, switching the endianness of the
processor swaps addresses of the 16-bit fields, but 32-bit accesses avoid the issue entirely.

0         Transfer complete interrupt is disabled.
1         Transfer complete interrupt is enabled.
When enabled, the interrupt pending register (IPR / IPRH) bit is set on transfer completion (upon
completion of the final TR in the PaRAM set). The bit (position) set in IPR or IPRH is the TCC value
specified. To generate a completion interrupt to the CPU, the corresponding IER[TCC] / IERH [TCC] bit
must be set.
19-18     Reserved              0         Reserved. Always write 0 to this bit; writes of 1 to this bit are not supported and attempts to do so may
result in undefined behavior.

##### 11.3.3.2.2 Channel Source Address (SRC)

The 32-bit source address parameter specifies the starting byte address of the source. For SAM in
increment mode, there are no alignment restrictions imposed by EDMA3. For SAM in constant addressing
mode, you must program the source address to be aligned to a 256-bit aligned address (5 LSBs of
address must be 0). The EDMA3TC will signal an error, if this rule is violated. See Section 11.3.12.3 for
additional details.


##### 11.3.3.2.3 Channel Destination Address (DST)

The 32-bit destination address parameter specifies the starting byte address of the destination. For DAM
in increment mode, there are no alignment restrictions imposed by EDMA3. For DAM in constant
addressing mode, you must program the destination address to be aligned to a 256-bit aligned address (5
LSBs of address must be 0). The EDMA3TC will signal an error, if this rule is violated. See
Section 11.3.12.3 for additional details.


##### 11.3.3.2.4 Count for 1st Dimension (ACNT)

ACNT represents the number of bytes within the 1st dimension of a transfer. ACNT is a 16-bit unsigned
value with valid values between 0 and 65 535. Therefore, the maximum number of bytes in an array is
65 535 bytes (64K – 1 bytes). ACNT must be greater than or equal to 1 for a TR to be submitted to
EDMA3TC. A transfer with ACNT equal to 0 is considered either a null or dummy transfer. A dummy or
null transfer generates a completion code depending on the settings of the completion bit fields in OPT.
See Section 11.3.3.5 and Section 11.3.5.3 for details on dummy/null completion conditions.


##### 11.3.3.2.5 Count for 2nd Dimension (BCNT)

BCNT is a 16-bit unsigned value that specifies the number of arrays of length ACNT. For normal
operation, valid values for BCNT are between 1 and 65 535. Therefore, the maximum number of arrays in
a frame is 65 535 (64K – 1 arrays). A transfer with BCNT equal to 0 is considered either a null or dummy
transfer. A dummy or null transfer generates a completion code depending on the settings of the
completion bit fields in OPT.
See Section 11.3.3.5 and Section 11.3.5.3 for details on dummy/null completion conditions.


##### 11.3.3.2.6 Count for 3rd Dimension (CCNT)

CCNT is a 16-bit unsigned value that specifies the number of frames in a block. Valid values for CCNT are
between 1 and 65 535. Therefore, the maximum number of frames in a block is 65 535 (64K – 1 frames).
A transfer with CCNT equal to 0 is considered either a null or dummy transfer. A dummy or null transfer
generates a completion code depending on the settings of the completion bit fields in OPT.
A CCNT value of 0 is considered either a null or dummy transfer. See Section 11.3.3.5 and
Section 11.3.5.3 for details on dummy/null completion conditions.


##### 11.3.3.2.7 BCNT Reload (BCNTRLD)

BCNTRLD is a 16-bit unsigned value used to reload the BCNT field once the last array in the
2nd dimension is transferred. This field is only used for A-synchronized transfers. In this case, the
EDMA3CC decrements the BCNT value by 1 on each TR submission. When BCNT reaches 0, the
EDMA3CC decrements CCNT and uses the BCNTRLD value to reinitialize the BCNT value.
For AB-synchronized transfers, the EDMA3CC submits the BCNT in the TR and the EDMA3TC
decrements BCNT appropriately. For AB-synchronized transfers, BCNTRLD is not used.


##### 11.3.3.2.8 Source B Index (SRCBIDX)

SRCBIDX is a 16-bit signed value (2s complement) used for source address modification between each
array in the 2nd dimension. Valid values for SRCBIDX are between –32 768 and 32 767. It provides a
byte address offset from the beginning of the source array to the beginning of the next source array. It
applies to both A-synchronized and AB-synchronized transfers. Some examples:
• SRCBIDX = 0000h (0): no address offset from the beginning of an array to the beginning of the next
array. All arrays are fixed to the same beginning address.
• SRCBIDX = 0003h (+3): the address offset from the beginning of an array to the beginning of the next
array in a frame is 3 bytes. For example, if the current array begins at address 1000h, the next array
begins at 1003h.
• SRCBIDX = FFFFh (–1): the address offset from the beginning of an array to the beginning of the next
array in a frame is –1 byte. For example, if the current array begins at address 5054h, the next array
begins at 5053h.


##### 11.3.3.2.9 Destination B Index (DSTBIDX)

DSTBIDX is a 16-bit signed value (2s complement) used for destination address modification between
each array in the 2nd dimension. Valid values for DSTBIDX are between –32 768 and 32 767. It provides
a byte address offset from the beginning of the destination array to the beginning of the next destination
array within the current frame. It applies to both A-synchronized and AB-synchronized transfers. See
SRCBIDX for examples.


##### 11.3.3.2.10 Source C Index (SRCCIDX)

SRCCIDX is a 16-bit signed value (2s complement) used for source address modification in the
3rd dimension. Valid values for SRCCIDX are between –32 768 and 32 767. It provides a byte address
offset from the beginning of the current array (pointed to by SRC address) to the beginning of the first
source array in the next frame. It applies to both A-synchronized and AB-synchronized transfers. Note that
when SRCCIDX is applied, the current array in an A-synchronized transfer is the last array in the frame
(Figure 11-5), while the current array in an AB-synchronized transfer is the first array in the frame
(Figure 11-6).


##### 11.3.3.2.11 Destination C Index (DSTCIDX)

DSTCIDX is a 16-bit signed value (2s complement) used for destination address modification in the
3rd dimension. Valid values are between –32 768 and 32 767. It provides a byte address offset from the
beginning of the current array (pointed to by DST address) to the beginning of the first destination array
TR in the next frame. It applies to both A-synchronized and AB-synchronized transfers. Note that when
DSTCIDX is applied, the current array in an A-synchronized transfer is the last array in the frame
(Figure 11-5), while the current array in a AB-synchronized transfer is the first array in the frame
(Figure 11-6).


##### 11.3.3.2.12 Link Address (LINK)

The EDMA3CC provides a mechanism, called linking, to reload the current PaRAM set upon its natural
termination (that is, after the count fields are decremented to 0) with a new PaRAM set. The 16-bit
parameter LINK specifies the byte address offset in the PaRAM from which the EDMA3CC loads/reloads
the next PaRAM set during linking.
You must program the link address to point to a valid aligned 32-byte PaRAM set. The 5 LSBs of the LINK
field should be cleared to 0.
The EDMA3CC ignores the upper 2 bits of the LINK entry, allowing the programmer the flexibility of
programming the link address as either an absolute/literal byte address or use the PaRAM-base-relative
offset address. Therefore, if you make use of the literal address with a range from 4000h to 7FFFh, it will
be treated as a PaRAM-base-relative value of 0000h to 3FFFh.
You should make sure to program the LINK field correctly, so that link update is requested from a PaRAM
address that falls in the range of the available PaRAM addresses on the device.
A LINK value of FFFFh is referred to as a NULL link that should cause the EDMA3CC to perform an
internal write of 0 to all entries of the current PaRAM set, except for the LINK field that is set to FFFFh.
Also, see Section 11.3.5 for details on terminating a transfer.


#### 11.3.3.3 Null PaRAM Set

A null PaRAM set is defined as a PaRAM set where all count fields (ACNT, BCNT, and CCNT) are
cleared to 0. If a PaRAM set associated with a channel is a NULL set, then when serviced by the
EDMA3CC, the bit corresponding to the channel is set in the associated event missed register (EMR,
EMRH, or QEMR). This bit remains set in the associated secondary event register (SER, SERH, or
QSER). This implies that any future events on the same channel are ignored by the EDMA3CC and you
are required to clear the bit in SER, SERH, or QSER for the channel. This is considered an error
condition, since events are not expected on a channel that is configured as a null transfer. See and for
more information on the SER and EMR registers, respectively.


#### 11.3.3.4 Dummy PaRAM Set

A dummy PaRAM set is defined as a PaRAM set where at least one of the count fields (ACNT, BCNT, or
CCNT) is cleared to 0 and at least one of the count fields is nonzero.
If a PaRAM set associated with a channel is a dummy set, then when serviced by the EDMA3CC, it will
not set the bit corresponding to the channel (DMA/QDMA) in the event missed register (EMR, EMRH, or
QEMR) and the secondary event register (SER, SERH, or QSER) bit gets cleared similar to a normal
transfer. Future events on that channel are serviced. A dummy transfer is a legal transfer of 0 bytes. For
more information, see the SER and EMR registers.


#### 11.3.3.5 Dummy Versus Null Transfer Comparison

There are some differences in the way the EDMA3CC logic treats a dummy versus a null transfer request.
A null transfer request is an error condition, but a dummy transfer is a legal transfer of 0 bytes. A null
transfer causes an error bit (En) in EMR to get set and the En bit in SER remains set, essentially
preventing any further transfers on that channel without clearing the associated error registers.
Table 11-8 summarizes the conditions and effects of null and dummy transfer requests.


**Table 11-8. Dummy and Null Transfer Request**

#### 11.3.3.6 Parameter Set Updates

When a TR is submitted for a given DMA/QDMA channel and its corresponding PaRAM set, the
EDMA3CC is responsible for updating the PaRAM set in anticipation of the next trigger event. For events
that are not final, this includes address and count updates; for final events, this includes the link update.
The specific PaRAM set entries that are updated depend on the channel’s synchronization type (A-
synchronized or B-synchronized) and the current state of the PaRAM set. A B-update refers to the
decrementing of BCNT in the case of A-synchronized transfers after the submission of successive TRs. A
C-update refers to the decrementing of CCNT in the case of A-synchronized transfers after BCNT TRs for
ACNT byte transfers have submitted. For AB-synchronized transfers, a C-update refers to the
decrementing of CCNT after submission of every transfer request.
See Table 11-9 for details and conditions on the parameter updates. A link update occurs when the
PaRAM set is exhausted, as described in Section 11.3.3.7.
After the TR is read from the PaRAM (and is in process of being submitted to EDMA3TC), the following
fields are updated if needed:
• A-synchronized: BCNT, CCNT, SRC, DST.
• AB-synchronized: CCNT, SRC, DST.
The following fields are not updated (except for during linking, where all fields are overwritten by the link
PaRAM set):
• A-synchronized: ACNT, BCNTRLD, SRCBIDX, DSTBIDX, SRCCIDX, DSTCIDX, OPT, LINK.
• AB-synchronized: ACNT, BCNT, BCNTRLD, SRCBIDX, DSTBIDX, SRCCIDX, DSTCIDX, OPT, LINK.


Note that PaRAM updates only pertain to the information that is needed to properly submit the next
transfer request to the EDMA3TC. Updates that occur while data is moved within a transfer request are
tracked within the transfer controller, and is detailed in Section 11.3.12. For A-synchronized transfers, the
EDMA3CC always submits a TRP for ACNT bytes (BCNT = 1 and CCNT = 1). For AB-synchronized
transfers, the EDMA3CC always submits a TRP for ACNT bytes of BCNT arrays (CCNT = 1). The
EDMA3TC is responsible for updating source and destination addresses within the array based on ACNT
and FWID (in OPT). For AB-synchronized transfers, the EDMA3TC is also responsible to update source
and destination addresses between arrays based on SRCBIDX and DSTBIDX.
Table 11-9 shows the details of parameter updates that occur within EDMA3CC for A-synchronized and
AB-synchronized transfers.

(1)
In all cases, no updates occur if OPT.STATIC == 1 for the current PaRAM set.


NOTE: The EDMA3CC includes no special hardware to detect when an indexed address update
calculation overflows/underflows. The address update will wrap across boundaries as
programmed by the user. You should ensure that no transfer is allowed to cross internal port
boundaries between peripherals. A single TR must target a single source/destination slave
endpoint.


#### 11.3.3.7 Linking Transfers

The EDMA3CC provides a mechanism known as linking, which allows the entire PaRAM set to be
reloaded from a location within the PaRAM memory map (for both DMA and QDMA channels). Linking is
especially useful for maintaining ping-pong buffers, circular buffering, and repetitive/continuous transfers
with no CPU intervention. Upon completion of a transfer, the current transfer parameters are reloaded with
the parameter set pointed that the 16-bit link address field of the current parameter set points to. Linking
only occurs when the STATIC bit in OPT is cleared.

NOTE: You should always link a transfer (EDMA3 or QDMA) to another useful transfer. If you must
terminate a transfer, then you should link the transfer to a NULL parameter set. See
Section 11.3.3.3.

The link update occurs after the current PaRAM set event parameters have been exhausted. An event's
parameters are exhausted when the EDMA3 channel controller has submitted all of the transfers that are
associated with the PaRAM set.
A link update occurs for null and dummy transfers depending on the state of the STATIC bit in OPT and
the LINK field. In both cases (null or dummy), if the value of LINK is FFFFh, then a null PaRAM set (with
all 0s and LINK set to FFFFh) is written to the current PaRAM set. Similarly, if LINK is set to a value other
than FFFFh, then the appropriate PaRAM location that LINK points to is copied to the current PaRAM set.
Once the channel completion conditions are met for an event, the transfer parameters that are located at
the link address are loaded into the current DMA or QDMA channel’s associated parameter set. This
indicates that the EDMA3CC reads the entire set (eight words) from the PaRAM set specified by LINK and
writes all eight words to the PaRAM set that is associated with the current channel. Figure 11-9 shows an
example of a linked transfer.
Any PaRAM set in the PaRAM can be used as a link/reload parameter set. The PaRAM sets associated
with peripheral synchronization events (see Section 11.3.6) should only be used for linking if the
corresponding events are disabled.
If a PaRAM set location is defined as a QDMA channel PaRAM set (by QCHMAPn), then copying the link
PaRAM set into the current QDMA channel PaRAM set is recognized as a trigger event. It is latched in
QER because a write to the trigger word was performed. You can use this feature to create a linked list of
transfers using a single QDMA channel and multiple PaRAM sets. See Section 11.3.4.2.
Linking to itself replicates the behavior of auto-initialization, thus facilitating the use of circular buffering
and repetitive transfers. After an EDMA3 channel exhausts its current PaRAM set, it reloads all of the
parameter set entries from another PaRAM set, which is initialized with values that are identical to the
original PaRAM set. Figure 11-9 shows an example of a linked to self transfer. Here, the PaRAM set 255
has the link field pointing to the address of parameter set 255 (linked to self).

NOTE: If the STATIC bit in OPT is set for a PaRAM set, then link updates are not performed.


#### 11.3.3.8 Constant Addressing Mode Transfers/Alignment Issues

If either SAM or DAM is set (constant addressing mode), then the source or destination address must be
aligned to a 256-bit aligned address, respectively, and the corresponding BIDX should be an even multiple
of 32 bytes (256 bits). The EDMA3CC does not recognize errors here, but the EDMA3TC asserts an error
if this is not true. See Section 11.3.12.3.

NOTE: The constant addressing (CONST) mode has limited applicability. The EDMA3 should be
configured for the constant addressing mode (SAM/DAM = 1) only if the transfer source or
destination (on-chip memory, off-chip memory controllers, slave peripherals) support the
constant addressing mode. See the device-specific data manual and/or peripheral user`s
guide to verify if the constant addressing mode is supported. If the constant addressing
mode is not supported, the similar logical transfer can be achieved using the increment
(INCR) mode (SAM/DAM =0) by appropriately programming the count and indices values.


#### 11.3.3.9 Element Size

The EDMA3 controller does not use element-size and element-indexing. Instead, all transfers are defined
in terms of all three dimensions: ACNT, BCNT, and CCNT. An element-indexed transfer is logically
achieved by programming ACNT to the size of the element and BCNT to the number of elements that
need to be transferred. For example, if you have 16-bit audio data and 256 audio samples that must be
transferred to a serial port, you can only do this by programming the ACNT = 2 (2 bytes) and BCNT = 256.

### 11.3.4 Initiating a DMA Transfer

There are multiple ways to initiate a programmed data transfer using the EDMA3 channel controller.
Transfers on DMA channels are initiated by three sources.
They are listed as follows:
• Event-triggered transfer request (this is the more typical usage of EDMA3): A peripheral, system, or
externally-generated event triggers a transfer request.
• Manually-triggered transfer request:The CPU to manually triggers a transfer by writing a 1 to the


corresponding bit in the event set register (ESR/ESRH).
•   Chain-triggered transfer request: A transfer is triggered on the completion of another transfer or sub-
transfer.
Transfers on QDMA channels are initiated by two sources. They are as follows:
• Auto-triggered transfer request: Writing to the programmed trigger word triggers a transfer.
• Link-triggered transfer requests: Writing to the trigger word triggers the transfer when linking occurs.


#### 11.3.4.1 DMA Channel


##### 11.3.4.1.1 Event-Triggered Transfer Request

When an event is asserted from a peripheral or device pins, it gets latched in the corresponding bit of the
event register (ER.En = 1). If the corresponding event in the event enable register (EER) is enabled
(EER.En = 1), then the EDMA3CC prioritizes and queues the event in the appropriate event queue. When
the event reaches the head of the queue, it is evaluated for submission as a transfer request to the
transfer controller.
If the PaRAM set is valid (not a NULL set), then a transfer request packet (TRP) is submitted to the
EDMA3TC and the En bit in ER is cleared. At this point, a new event can be safely received by the
EDMA3CC.
If the PaRAM set associated with the channel is a NULL set (see Section 11.3.3.3), then no transfer
request (TR) is submitted and the corresponding En bit in ER is cleared and simultaneously the
corresponding channel bit is set in the event miss register (EMR.En = 1) to indicate that the event was
discarded due to a null TR being serviced. Good programming practices should include cleaning the event
missed error before re-triggering the DMA channel.
When an event is received, the corresponding event bit in the event register is set (ER.En = 1), regardless
of the state of EER.En. If the event is disabled when an external event is received (ER.En = 1 and
EER.En = 0), the ER.En bit remains set. If the event is subsequently enabled (EER.En = 1), then the
pending event is processed by the EDMA3CC and the TR is processed/submitted, after which the ER.En
bit is cleared.
If an event is being processed (prioritized or is in the event queue) and another sync event is received for
the same channel prior to the original being cleared (ER.En != 0), then the second event is registered as a
missed event in the corresponding bit of the event missed register (EMR.En = 1).
See Section 9.2.3, EDMA Event Multiplexing, for a description of how DMA events map to the EDMA
event crossbar. See Section 11.3.20, EDMA Events, for a table of direct and crossbar mapped EDMA
events.


##### 11.3.4.1.2 Manually Triggered Transfer Request

The CPU or any EDMA programmer initiates a DMA transfer by writing to the event set register (ESR).
Writing a 1 to an event bit in the ESR results in the event being prioritized/queued in the appropriate event
queue, regardless of the state of the EER.En bit. When the event reaches the head of the queue, it is
evaluated for submission as a transfer request to the transfer controller.
As in the event-triggered transfers, if the PaRAM set associated with the channel is valid (it is not a null
set) then the TR is submitted to the associated EDMA3TC and the channel can be triggered again.
If the PaRAM set associated with the channel is a NULL set (see Section 11.3.3.3), then no transfer
request (TR) is submitted and the corresponding En bit in ER is cleared and simultaneously the
corresponding channel bit is set in the event miss register (EMR.En = 1) to indicate that the event was
discarded due to a null TR being serviced. Good programming practices should include clearing the event
missed error before re-triggering the DMA channel.
If an event is being processed (prioritized or is in the event queue) and the same channel is manually set
by a write to the corresponding channel bit of the event set register (ESR.En = 1) prior to the original
being cleared (ESR.En = 0), then the second event is registered as a missed event in the corresponding
bit of the event missed register (EMR.En = 1).


##### 11.3.4.1.3 Chain-Triggered Transfer Request

Chaining is a mechanism by which the completion of one transfer automatically sets the event for another
channel. When a chained completion code is detected, the value of which is dictated by the transfer
completion code (TCC[5:0] in OPT of the PaRAM set associated with the channel), it results in the
corresponding bit in the chained event register (CER) to be set (CER.E[TCC] = 1).
Once a bit is set in CER, the EDMA3CC prioritizes and queues the event in the appropriate event queue.
When the event reaches the head of the queue, it is evaluated for submission as a transfer request to the
transfer controller.
As in the event-triggered transfers, if the PaRAM set associated with the channel is valid (it is not a null
set) then the TR is submitted to the associated EDMA3TC and the channel can be triggered again.
If the PaRAM set associated with the channel is a NULL set (see Section 11.3.3.3), then no transfer
request (TR) is submitted and the corresponding En bit in CER is cleared and simultaneously the
corresponding channel bit is set in the event miss register (EMR.En = 1) to indicate that the event was
discarded due to a null TR being serviced. In this case, the error condition must be cleared by you before
the DMA channel can be re-triggered. Good programming practices might include clearing the event
missed error before re-triggering the DMA channel.
If a chaining event is being processed (prioritized or queued) and another chained event is received for
the same channel prior to the original being cleared (CER.En != 0), then the second chained event is
registered as a missed event in the corresponding channel bit of the event missed register (EMR.En = 1).

NOTE: Chained event registers, event registers, and event set registers operate independently. An
event (En) can be triggered by any of the trigger sources (event-triggered, manually-
triggered, or chain-triggered).


#### 11.3.4.2 QDMA Channels


##### 11.3.4.2.1 Auto-triggered and Link-Triggered Transfer Request

QDMA-based transfer requests are issued when a QDMA event gets latched in the QDMA event register
(QER.En = 1). A bit corresponding to a QDMA channel is set in the QDMA event register (QER) when the
following occurs:
• A CPU (or any EDMA3 programmer) write occurs to a PaRAM address that is defined as a QDMA
channel trigger word (programmed in the QDMA channel mapping register (QCHMAPn)) for the
particular QDMA channel and the QDMA channel is enabled via the QDMA event enable register
(QEER.En = 1).
• EDMA3CC performs a link update on a PaRAM set address that is configured as a QDMA channel
(matches QCHMAPn settings) and the corresponding channel is enabled via the QDMA event enable
register (QEER.En = 1).
Once a bit is set in QER, the EDMA3CC prioritizes and queues the event in the appropriate event queue.
When the event reaches the head of the queue, it is evaluated for submission as a transfer request to the
transfer controller.
As in the event-triggered transfers, if the PaRAM set associated with the channel is valid (it is not a null
set) then the TR is submitted to the associated EDMA3TC and the channel can be triggered again.
If a bit is already set in QER (QER.En = 1) and a second QDMA event for the same QDMA channel
occurs prior to the original being cleared, the second QDMA event gets captured in the QDMA event miss
register (QEMR.En = 1).


#### 11.3.4.3 Comparison Between DMA and QDMA Channels

The primary difference between DMA and QDMA channels is the event/channel synchronization. QDMA
events are either auto-triggered or link triggered. auto-triggering allows QDMA channels to be triggered by
CPU(s) with a minimum number of linear writes to PaRAM. Link triggering allows a linked list of transfers
to be executed, using a single QDMA PaRAM set and multiple link PaRAM sets.


A QDMA transfer is triggered when a CPU (or other EDMA3 programmer) writes to the trigger word of the
QDMA channel parameter set (auto-triggered) or when the EDMA3CC performs a link update on a
PaRAM set that has been mapped to a QDMA channel (link triggered). Note that for CPU triggered
(manually triggered) DMA channels, in addition to writing to the PaRAM set, it is required to write to the
event set register (ESR) to kick-off the transfer.
QDMA channels are typically for cases where a single event will accomplish a complete transfer since the
CPU (or EDMA3 programmer) must reprogram some portion of the QDMA PaRAM set in order to re-
trigger the channel. In other words, QDMA transfers are programmed with BCNT = CCNT = 1 for A-
synchronized transfers, and CCNT = 1 for AB-synchronized transfers.
Additionally, since linking is also supported (if STATIC = 0 in OPT) for QDMA transfers, it allows you to
initiate a linked list of QDMAs, so when EDMA3CC copies over a link PaRAM set (including the write to
the trigger word), the current PaRAM set mapped to the QDMA channel will automatically be recognized
as a valid QDMA event and initiate another set of transfers as specified by the linked set.


### 11.3.5 Completion of a DMA Transfer

A parameter set for a given channel is complete when the required number of transfer requests is
submitted (based on receiving the number of synchronization events). The expected number of TRs for a
non-null/non-dummy transfer is shown in Table 11-10 for both synchronization types along with state of
the PaRAM set prior to the final TR being submitted. When the counts (BCNT and/or CCNT) are this
value, the next TR results in a:
• Final chaining or interrupt codes to be sent by the transfer controllers (instead of intermediate).
• Link updates (linking to either null or another valid link set).


**Table 11-10. Expected Number of Transfers for Non-Null Transfer**

Sync Mode           Counts at time 0       Total # Transfers                               Counts prior to final TR

You must program the PaRAM OPT field with a specific transfer completion code (TCC) along with the
other OPT fields (TCCHEN, TCINTEN, ITCCHEN, and ITCINTEN bits) to indicate whether the completion
code is to be used for generating a chained event or/and for generating an interrupt upon completion of a
transfer.
The specific TCC value (6-bit binary value) programmed dictates which of the 64-bits in the chain event
register (CER[TCC]) and/or interrupt pending register (IPR[TCC]) is set.
You can also selectively program whether the transfer controller sends back completion codes on
completion of the final transfer request (TR) of a parameter set (TCCHEN or TCINTEN), for all but the
final transfer request (TR) of a parameter set (ITCCHEN or ITCINTEN), or for all TRs of a parameter set
(both). See Section 11.3.8 for details on chaining (intermediate/final chaining) and Section 11.3.9 for
details on intermediate/final interrupt completion.
A completion detection interface exists between the EDMA3 channel controller and transfer controller(s).
This interface sends back information from the transfer controller to the channel controller to indicate that
a specific transfer is completed. Completion of a transfer is used for generating chained events and/or
generating interrupts to the CPU(s).
All DMA/QDMA PaRAM sets must also specify a link address value. For repetitive transfers such as ping-
pong buffers, the link address value should point to another predefined PaRAM set. Alternatively, a non-
repetitive transfer should set the link address value to the null link value. The null link value is defined as
FFFFh. See Section 11.3.3.7 for more details.


NOTE: Any incoming events that are mapped to a null PaRAM set results in an error condition. The
error condition should be cleared before the corresponding channel is used again. See
Section 11.3.3.5.

There are three ways the EDMA3CC gets updated/informed about a transfer completion: normal
completion, early completion, and dummy/null completion. This applies to both chained events and
completion interrupt generation.


#### 11.3.5.1 Normal Completion

In normal completion mode (TCCMODE = 0 in OPT), the transfer or sub-transfer is considered to be
complete when the EDMA3 channel controller receives the completion codes from the EDMA3 transfer
controller. In this mode, the completion code to the channel controller is posted by the transfer controller
after it receives a signal from the destination peripheral. Normal completion is typically used to generate
an interrupt to inform the CPU that a set of data is ready for processing.


#### 11.3.5.2 Early Completion

In early completion mode (TCCMODE = 1 in OPT), the transfer is considered to be complete when the
EDMA3 channel controller submits the transfer request (TR) to the EDMA3 transfer controller. In this
mode, the channel controller generates the completion code internally. Early completion is typically useful
for chaining, as it allows subsequent transfers to be chained-triggered while the previous transfer is still in
progress within the transfer controller, maximizing the overall throughput of the set of the transfers.


#### 11.3.5.3 Dummy or Null Completion

This is a variation of early completion. Dummy or null completion is associated with a dummy set
(Section 11.3.3.4) or null set (Section 11.3.3.3). In both cases, the EDMA3 channel controller does not
submit the associated transfer request to the EDMA3 transfer controller(s). However, if the set
(dummy/null) has the OPT field programmed to return completion code (intermediate/final
interrupt/chaining completion), then it will set the appropriate bits in the interrupt pending registers
(IPR/IPRH) or chained event register (CER/CERH). The internal early completion path is used by the
channel controller to return the completion codes internally (that is, EDMA3CC generates the completion
code).


### 11.3.6 Event, Channel, and PaRAM Mapping

Several of the 64 DMA channels are tied to a specific hardware event, thus allowing events from device
peripherals or external hardware to trigger transfers. A DMA channel typically requests a data transfer
when it receives its event (apart from manually-triggered, chain-triggered, and other transfers). The
amount of data transferred per synchronization event depends on the channel’s configuration (ACNT,
BCNT, CCNT, etc.) and the synchronization type (A-synchronized or AB-synchronized).
The association of an event to a channel is fixed, each DMA channel has one specific event associated
with it. See Section 9.2.3, EDMA Event Multiplexing, for a description of how DMA events map to the
EDMA event crossbar. See Section 11.3.20, EDMA Events, for a table of direct and crossbar mapped
EDMA events.
In an application, if a channel does not use the associated synchronization event or if it does not have an
associated synchronization event (unused), that channel can be used for manually-triggered or chained-
triggered transfers, for linking/reloading, or as a QDMA channel.


#### 11.3.6.1 DMA Channel to PaRAM Mapping

The mapping between the DMA channel numbers and the PaRAM sets is programmable (see Table 11-
5). The DMA channel mapping registers (DCHMAPn) in the EDMA3CC provide programmability that
allows the DMA channels to be mapped to any of the PaRAM sets in the PaRAM memory map. Figure 11-
11 illustrates the use of DCHMAP. There is one DCHMAP register per channel.

#### 11.3.6.2 QDMA Channel to PaRAM Mapping

The mapping between the QDMA channels and the PaRAM sets is programmable. The QDMA channel
mapping register (QCHMAP) in the EDMA3CC allows you to map the QDMA channels to any of the
PaRAM sets in the PaRAM memory map. Figure 11-12 illustrates the use of QCHMAP.
Additionally, QCHMAP allows you to program the trigger word in the PaRAM set for the QDMA channel. A
trigger word is one of the eight words in the PaRAM set. For a QDMA transfer to occur, a valid TR
synchronization event for EDMA3CC is a write to the trigger word in the PaRAM set pointed to by
QCHMAP for a particular QDMA channel. By default, QDMA channels are mapped to PaRAM set 0. You
must appropriately re-map PaRAM set 0 before you use it.

### 11.3.7 EDMA3 Channel Controller Regions

The EDMA3 channel controller divides its address space into eight regions. Individual channel resources
are assigned to a specific region, where each region is typically assigned to a specific EDMA programmer.
You can design the application software to use regions or to ignore them altogether. You can use active
memory protection in conjunction with regions so that only a specific EDMA programmer (for example,
privilege identification) or privilege level (for example, user vs. supervisor) is allowed access to a given
region, and thus to a given DMA or QDMA channel. This allows robust system-level DMA code where
each EDMA programmer only modifies the state of the assigned resources. Memory protection is
described in Section 11.3.10.


#### 11.3.7.1 Region Overview

The EDMA3 channel controller memory-mapped registers are divided in three main categories:
1. Global registers
2. Global region channel registers
3. Shadow region channel registers
The global registers are located at a single/fixed location in the EDMA3CC memory map. These registers
control EDMA3 resource mapping and provide debug visibility and error tracking information.
The channel registers (including DMA, QDMA, and interrupt registers) are accessible via the global
channel region address range, or in the shadow n channel region address range(s). For example, the
event enable register (EER) is visible at the global address of EDMA Base Address + 1020h or region
addresses of EDMA Base Address + 2020h for region 0, EDMA Base Address + 2220h for region 1, …
EDMA Base Address + 2E20h for region 7.
The DMA region access enable registers (DRAEm) and the QDMA region access enable registers
(QRAEn) control the underlying control register bits that are accessible via the shadow region address
space (except for IEVALn). Table 11-11 lists the registers in the shadow region memory map. See the
EDMA3CC memory map () for the complete global and shadow region memory maps. Figure 11-13
illustrates the conceptual view of the regions.

#### 11.3.7.2 Channel Controller Regions

There are eight EDMA3 shadow regions (and associated memory maps). Associated with each shadow
region are a set of registers defining which channels and interrupt completion codes belong to that region.
These registers are user-programmed per region to assign ownership of the DMA/QDMA channels to a
region.
• DRAEm and DRAEHm: One register pair exists for each of the shadow regions. The number of bits in
each register pair matches the number of DMA channels (64 DMA channels). These registers need to
be programmed to assign ownership of DMA channels and interrupt (or TCC codes) to the respective
region. Accesses to DMA and interrupt registers via the shadow region address view are filtered
through the DRAE/DRAEH pair. A value of 1 in the corresponding DRAE(H) bit implies that the
corresponding DMA/interrupt channel is accessible; a value of 0 in the corresponding DRAE(H) bit
forces writes to be discarded and returns a value of 0 for reads.
• QRAEn: One register exists for every region. The number of bits in each register matches the number
of QDMA channels (4 QDMA channels). These registers must be programmed to assign ownership of
QDMA channels to the respective region. To enable a channel in a shadow region using shadow
region 0 QEER, the respective bit in QRAE must be set or writing into QEESR will not have the desired
effect.
• MPPAn and MPPAG: One register exists for every region. This register defines the privilege level,
requestor, and types of accesses allowed to a region's memory-mapped registers.
It is typical for an application to have a unique assignment of QDMA/DMA channels (and, therefore, a
given bit position) to a given region.
The use of shadow regions allows for restricted access to EDMA3 resources (DMA channels, QDMA
channels, TCC, interrupts) by tasks in a system by setting or clearing bits in the DRAE/ORAE registers. If
exclusive access to any given channel / TCC code is required for a region, then only that region's
DRAE/ORAE should have the associated bit set.

Example 11-1. Resource Pool Division Across Two Regions

This example illustrates a judicious resource pool division across two regions, assuming region 0 must be
allocated 16 DMA channels (0-15) and 1 QDMA channel (0) and 32 TCC codes (0-15 and 48-63). Region 1
needs to be allocated 16 DMA channels (16-32) and the remaining 7 QDMA channels (1-7) and TCC codes
(16-47). DRAE should be equal to the OR of the bits that are required for the DMA channels and the TCC
codes:
Region 0: DRAEH, DRAE = 0xFFFF0000, 0x0000FFFF QRAE = 0x0000001
Region 1: DRAEH, DRAE = 0x0000FFFF, 0xFFFF0000 QRAE = 0x00000FE


#### 11.3.7.3 Region Interrupts

In addition to the EDMA3CC global completion interrupt, there is an additional completion interrupt line
that is associated with every shadow region. Along with the interrupt enable register (IER), DRAE acts as
a secondary interrupt enable for the respective shadow region interrupts. See Section 11.3.9 for more
information.


### 11.3.8 Chaining EDMA3 Channels

The channel chaining capability for the EDMA3 allows the completion of an EDMA3 channel transfer to
trigger another EDMA3 channel transfer. The purpose is to allow you the ability to chain several events
through one event occurrence.
Chaining is different from linking (Section 11.3.3.7). The EDMA3 link feature reloads the current channel
parameter set with the linked parameter set. The EDMA3 chaining feature does not modify or update any
channel parameter set; it provides a synchronization event to the chained channel (see Section 11.3.4.1.3
for chain-triggered transfer requests).
Chaining is achieved at either final transfer completion or intermediate transfer completion, or both, of the
current channel. Consider a channel m (DMA/QDMA) required to chain to channel n. Channel number n
(0-63) needs to be programmed into the TCC bit of channel m channel options parameter (OPT) set.
• If final transfer completion chaining (TCCHEN = 1 in OPT) is enabled, the chain-triggered event occurs
after the submission of the last transfer request of channel m is either submitted or completed
(depending on early or normal completion).
• If intermediate transfer completion chaining (ITCCHEN = 1 in OPT) is enabled, the chain-triggered
event occurs after every transfer request, except the last of channel m is either submitted or completed
(depending on early or normal completion).
• If both final and intermediate transfer completion chaining (TCCHEN = 1 and ITCCHEN = 1 in OPT)
are enabled, then the chain-trigger event occurs after every transfer request is submitted or completed
(depending on early or normal completion).
Table 11-13 illustrates the number of chain event triggers occurring in different synchronized scenarios.
Consider channel 31 programmed with ACNT = 3, BCNT = 4, CCNT = 5, and TCC = 30.


**Table 11-13. Chain Event Triggers**

(Number of chained event triggers on channel 30)
Options                                A-Synchronized                                  AB-Synchronized
TCCHEN = 1, ITCCHEN = 0                1 (Owing to the last TR)                        1 (Owing to the last TR)
TCCHEN = 0, ITCCHEN = 1                19 (Owing to all but the last TR)               4 (Owing to all but the last TR)
TCCHEN = 1, ITCCHEN = 1                20 (Owing to a total of 20 TRs)                 5 (Owing to a total of 5 TRs)


### 11.3.9 EDMA3 Interrupts

The EDMA3 interrupts are divided into 2 categories: transfer completion interrupts and error interrupts.
There are nine region interrupts, eight shadow regions and one global region. The transfer completion
interrupts are listed in Table 11-14. The transfer completion interrupts and the error interrupts from the
transfer controllers are all routed to the ARM interrupt controllers.


**Table 11-14. EDMA3 Transfer Completion Interrupts**

#### 11.3.9.1 Transfer Completion Interrupts

The EDMA3CC is responsible for generating transfer completion interrupts to the CPU(s) (and other
EDMA3 masters). The EDMA3 generates a single completion interrupt per shadow region, as well as one
for the global region on behalf of all 64 channels. The various control registers and bit fields facilitate
EDMA3 interrupt generation.
The software architecture should either use the global interrupt or the shadow interrupts, but not both.
The transfer completion code (TCC) value is directly mapped to the bits of the interrupt pending register
(IPR/IPRH). For example, if TCC = 10 0001b, IPRH[1] is set after transfer completion, and results in
interrupt generation to the CPU(s) if the completion interrupt is enabled for the CPU. See
Section 11.3.9.1.1 for details on enabling EDMA3 transfer completion interrupts.
When a completion code is returned (as a result of early or normal completions), the corresponding bit in
IPR/IPRH is set if transfer completion interrupt (final/intermediate) is enabled in the channel options
parameter (OPT) for a PaRAM set associated with the transfer.

(1)
Bit fields IPR[32-63] correspond to bits 0 to 31 in IPRH, respectively.


You can program the transfer completion code (TCC) to any value for a DMA/QDMA channel. A direct
relation between the channel number and the transfer completion code value does not need to exist. This
allows multiple channels having the same transfer completion code value to cause a CPU to execute the
same interrupt service routine (ISR) for different channels.
If the channel is used in the context of a shadow region and you intend for the shadow region interrupt to
be asserted, then ensure that the bit corresponding to the TCC code is enabled in IER/IERH and in the
corresponding shadow region's DMA region access registers (DRAE/DRAEH).
You can enable Interrupt generation at either final transfer completion or intermediate transfer completion,
or both. Consider channel m as an example.
• If the final transfer interrupt (TCCINT = 1 in OPT) is enabled, the interrupt occurs after the last transfer
request of channel m is either submitted or completed (depending on early or normal completion).
• If the intermediate transfer interrupt (ITCCINT = 1 in OPT) is enabled, the interrupt occurs after every
transfer request, except the last TR of channel m is either submitted or completed (depending on early
or normal completion).
• If both final and intermediate transfer completion interrupts (TCCINT = 1, and ITCCINT = 1 in OPT) are

enabled, then the interrupt occurs after every transfer request is submitted or completed (depending on
early or normal completion).
Table 11-17 shows the number of interrupts that occur in different synchronized scenarios. Consider
channel 31, programmed with ACNT = 3, BCNT = 4, CCNT = 5, and TCC = 30.

##### 11.3.9.1.1 Enabling Transfer Completion Interrupts

For the EDMA3 channel controller to assert a transfer completion to the external environment, the
interrupts must be enabled in the EDMA3CC. This is in addition to setting up the TCINTEN and ITCINTEN
bits in OPT of the associated PaRAM set.
The EDMA3 channel controller has interrupt enable registers (IER/IERH) and each bit location in
IER/IERH serves as a primary enable for the corresponding interrupt pending registers (IPR/IPRH).
All of the interrupt registers (IER, IESR, IECR, and IPR) are either manipulated from the global DMA
channel region, or by the DMA channel shadow regions. The shadow regions provide a view to the same
set of physical registers that are in the global region.
The EDMA3 channel controller has a hierarchical completion interrupt scheme that uses a single set of
interrupt pending registers (IPR/IPRH) and single set of interrupt enable registers (IER/IERH). The
programmable DMA region access enable registers (DRAE/DRAEH) provides a second level of interrupt
masking. The global region interrupt output is gated based on the enable mask that is provided by
IER/IERH. see Figure 11-14
The region interrupt outputs are gated by IER and the specific DRAE/DRAEH associated with the region.
See Figure 11-14.

For the EDMA3CC to generate the transfer completion interrupts that are associated with each shadow
region, the following conditions must be true:
• EDMA3CC_INT0: (IPR.E0 & IER.E0 & DRAE0.E0) | (IPR.E1 & IER.E1 & DRAE0.E1) | …|(IPRH.E63 &
IERH.E63 & DRAHE0.E63)
• EDMA3CC_INT1: (IPR.E0 & IER.E0 & DRAE1.E0) | (IPR.E1 & IER.E1 & DRAE1.E1) | …| (IPRH.E63
& IERH.E63 & DRAHE1.E63)
• EDMA3CC_INT2 : (IPR.E0 & IER.E0 & DRAE2.E0) | (IPR.E1 & IER.E1 & DRAE2.E1) | …|(IPRH.E63
& IERH.E63 & DRAHE2.E63)....
• Up to EDMA3CC_INT7 : (IPR.E0 & IER.E0 & DRAE7.E0) | (IPR.E1 & IER.E1 & DRAE7.E1)
| …|(IPRH.E63 & IERH.E63 & DRAEH7.E63)

NOTE: The DRAE/DRAEH for all regions are expected to be set up at system initialization and to
remain static for an extended period of time. The interrupt enable registers should be used
for dynamic enable/disable of individual interrupts.
Because there is no relation between the TCC value and the DMA/QDMA channel, it is
possible, for example, for DMA channel 0 to have the OPT.TCC = 63 in its associated
PaRAM set. This would mean that if a transfer completion interrupt is enabled
(OPT.TCINTEN or OPT.ITCINTEN is set), then based on the TCC value, IPRH.E63 is set up
on completion. For proper channel operations and interrupt generation using the shadow
region map, you must program the DRAE/DRAEH that is associated with the shadow region
to have read/write access to both bit 0 (corresponding to channel 0) and bit 63
(corresponding to IPRH bit that is set upon completion).


##### 11.3.9.1.2 Clearing Transfer Completion Interrupts

Transfer completion interrupts that are latched to the interrupt pending registers (IPR/IPRH) are cleared by
writing a 1 to the corresponding bit in the interrupt pending clear register (ICR/ICRH). For example, a write
of 1 to ICR.E0 clears a pending interrupt in IPR.E0.
If an incoming transfer completion code (TCC) gets latched to a bit in IPR/IPRH, then additional bits that
get set due to a subsequent transfer completion will not result in asserting the EDMA3CC completion
interrupt. In order for the completion interrupt to be pulsed, the required transition is from a state where no
enabled interrupts are set to a state where at least one enabled interrupt is set.


#### 11.3.9.2 EDMA3 Interrupt Servicing

Upon completion of a transfer (early or normal completion), the EDMA3 channel controller sets the
appropriate bit in the interrupt pending registers (IPR/IPRH), as the transfer completion codes specify. If
the completion interrupts are appropriately enabled, then the CPU enters the interrupt service routine
(ISR) when the completion interrupt is asserted.
After servicing the interrupt, the ISR should clear the corresponding bit in IPR/IPRH, thereby enabling
recognition of future interrupts. The EDMA3CC will only assert additional completion interrupts when all
IPR/IPRH bits clear.
When one interrupt is serviced many other transfer completions may result in additional bits being set in
IPR/IPRH, thereby resulting in additional interrupts. Each of the bits in IPR/IPRH may need different types
of service; therefore, the ISR may check all pending interrupts and continue until all of the posted
interrupts are serviced appropriately.
Examples of pseudo code for a CPU interrupt service routine for an EDMA3CC completion interrupt are
shown in Example 11-2 and Example 11-3.
The ISR routine in Example 11-2 is more exhaustive and incurs a higher latency.

Example 11-2. Interrupt Servicing

The pseudo code:
1. Reads the interrupt pending register (IPR/IPRH).
2. Performs the operations needed.
3. Writes to the interrupt pending clear register (ICR/ICRH) to clear the corresponding IPR/IPRH bit(s).
4. Reads IPR/IPRH again:
a. If IPR/IPRH is not equal to 0, repeat from step 2 (implies occurrence of new event between step 2 to
step 4).
b. If IPR/IPRH is equal to 0, this should assure you that all of the enabled interrupts are inactive.

NOTE: An event may occur during step 4 while the IPR/IPRH bits are read as 0 and the application is
still in the interrupt service routine. If this happens, a new interrupt is recorded in the device
interrupt controller and a new interrupt generates as soon as the application exits in the interrupt
service routine.


Example 11-3 is less rigorous, with less burden on the software in polling for set interrupt bits, but can
occasionally cause a race condition as mentioned above.

Example 11-3. Interrupt Servicing

If you want to leave any enabled and pending (possibly lower priority) interrupts; you must force the interrupt
logic to reassert the interrupt pulse by setting the EVAL bit in the interrupt evaluation register (IEVAL).
The pseudo code is as follows:
1. Enters ISR.


Example 11-3. Interrupt Servicing (continued)
2. Reads IPR/IPRH.
3. For the condition that is set in IPR/IPRH that you want to service, do the following:
a. Service interrupt as the application requires.
b. Clear the bit for serviced conditions (others may still be set, and other transfers may have resulted in
returning the TCC to EDMA3CC after step 2).
4. Reads IPR/IPRH prior to exiting the ISR:
a. If IPR/IPRH is equal to 0, then exit the ISR.
b. If IPR/IPRH is not equal to 0, then set IEVAL so that upon exit of ISR, a new interrupt triggers if any
enabled interrupts are still pending.


#### 11.3.9.3 Interrupt Evaluation Operations

The EDMA3CC has interrupt evaluate registers (IEVAL) that exist in the global region and in each shadow
region. The registers in the shadow region are the only registers in the DMA channel shadow region
memory map that are not affected by the settings for the DMA region access enable registers
(DRAE/DRAEH). Writing a 1 to the EVAL bit in the registers that are associated with a particular shadow
region results in pulsing the associated region interrupt (global or shadow), if any enabled interrupt (via
IER/IERH) is still pending (IPR/IPRH). This register assures that the CPU does not miss the interrupts (or
the EDMA3 master associated with the shadow region) if the software architecture chooses not to use all
interrupts. See Example 11-3 for the use of IEVAL in the EDMA3 interrupt service routine (ISR).
Similarly, an error evaluation register (EEVAL) exists in the global region. Writing a 1 to the EVAL bit in
EEVAL causes the pulsing of the error interrupt if any pending errors are in EMR/EMRH, QEMR, or
CCERR. The EVAL bit must be written with 1 to clear interrupts to the INTC, even when all error interrupt
registers are cleared. See Section 11.3.9.4, Error Interrupts, for additional information regarding error
interrupts.

NOTE: While using IEVAL for shadow region completion interrupts, ensure that the IEVAL operated
upon is from that particular shadow region memory map.


#### 11.3.9.4 Error Interrupts

The EDMA3CC error registers provide the capability to differentiate error conditions (event missed,
threshold exceed, etc.). Additionally, setting the error bits in these registers results in asserting the
EDMA3CC error interrupt. If the EDMA3CC error interrupt is enabled in the device interrupt controller(s),
then it allows the CPU(s) to handle the error conditions.
The EDMA3CC has a single error interrupt (EDMA3CC_ERRINT) that is asserted for all EDMA3CC error
conditions. There are four conditions that cause the error interrupt to pulse:
• DMA missed events: for all 64 DMA channels. DMA missed events are latched in the event missed
registers (EMR/EMRH).
• QDMA missed events: for all 8 QDMA channels. QDMA missed events are latched in the QDMA event
missed register (QEMR).
• Threshold exceed: for all event queues. These are latched in EDMA3CC error register (CCERR).
• TCC error: for outstanding transfer requests that are expected to return completion code (TCCHEN or
TCINTEN bit in OPT is set to 1) exceeding the maximum limit of 63. This is also latched in the
EDMA3CC error register (CCERR).
Figure 11-15 illustrates the EDMA3CC error interrupt generation operation.
If any of the bits are set in the error registers due to any error condition, the EDMA3CC_ERRINT is always
asserted, as there are no enables for masking these error events. Similar to transfer completion interrupts
(EDMA3CC_INT), the error interrupt also only pulses when the error interrupt condition transitions from no
errors being set to at least one error being set. If additional error events are latched prior to the original
error bits clearing, the EDMA3CC does not generate additional interrupt pulses.
To reduce the burden on the software, there is an error evaluate register (EEVAL) that allows re-
evaluation of pending set error events/bits, similar to the interrupt evaluate register (IEVAL). You can use
this so that the CPU(s) does not miss any error events. You must write a 1 to the EEVAL.EVAL bit to clear
interrupts to the INTC after all error registers have been cleared.

NOTE: It is good practice to enable the error interrupt in the device interrupt controller and to
associate an interrupt service routine with it to address the various error conditions
appropriately. Doing so puts less burden on the software (polling for error status);
additionally, it provides a good debug mechanism for unexpected error conditions.

### 11.3.10 Memory Protection

The EDMA3 channel controller supports two kinds of memory protection: active and proxy.


#### 11.3.10.1 Active Memory Protection

Active memory protection is a feature that allows or prevents read and write accesses (by any EDMA3
programmer) to the EDMA3CC registers (based on permission characteristics that you program). Active
memory protection is achieved by a set of memory protection permissions attribute (MPPA) registers.
The EDMA3CC register map is divided into three categories:
• a global region.
• a global channel region.
• eight shadow regions.
Each shadow region consists of the respective shadow region registers and the associated PaRAM. For
more detailed information regarding the contents of a shadow region, refer to section Table 11-11.
Each of the eight shadow regions has an associated MPPA register (MPPAn) that defines the specific
requestor(s) and types of requests that are allowed to the regions resources.
The global channel region is also protected with a memory-mapped register (MPPAG). The MPPAG
applies to the global region and to the global channel region, except the other MPPA registers themselves.
For more detailed information on the list of the registers in each region, refer to the register memory-map
in section Table 11-19.
See for the bit field descriptions of MPPAn. The MPPAn have a certain set of access rules.
Table 11-18 shows the accesses that are allowed or not allowed to the MPPAG and MPPAn. The active
memory protection uses the PRIV and PRIVID attributes of the EDMA programmer. The PRIV is the
privilege level (i.e., user vs. supervisor). The PRIVID refers to a privilege ID with a number that is
associated with an EDMA3 programmer. See the device-specific data manual for the PRIVIDs that are
associated with potential EDMA3 programmers.


**Table 11-18. Allowed Accesses**

Access                   Supervisor                User
Read                     Yes                       Yes
Write                    Yes                       No


Table 11-19 describes the MPPA register mapping for the shadow regions (which includes shadow region
registers and PaRAM addresses).
The region-based MPPA registers are used to protect accesses to the DMA shadow regions and the
associated region PaRAM. Because there are eight regions, there are eight MPPA region registers
(MPPA[0-7]).

The PARAM region is divided into 8 regions referred to as an octant.


Example Access denied.
Write access to shadow region 7's event enable set register (EESR):
1. The original value of the event enable register (EER) at address offset 0x1020 is 0x0.
2. The MPPA[7] is set to prevent user level accesses (UW = 0, UR = 0), but it allows supervisor level
accesses (SW = 1, SR = 1) with a privilege ID of 0. (AID0 = 1).
3. An EDMA3 programmer with a privilege ID of 0 attempts to perform a user-level write of a value of
0xFF00FF00 to shadow region 7's event enable set register (EESR) at address offset 0x2E30. Note
that the EER is a read-only register and the only way that you can write to it is by writing to the EESR.
Also remember that there is only one physical register for EER, EESR, etc. and that the shadow
regions only provide to the same physical set.
4. Since the MPPA[7] has UW = 0, though the privilege ID of the write access is set to 0, the access is
not allowed and the EER is not written to.

#### 11.3.10.2 Proxy Memory Protection

Proxy memory protection allows an EDMA3 transfer programmed by a given EDMA3 programmer to have
its permissions travel with the transfer through the EDMA3TC. The permissions travel along with the read
transactions to the source and the write transactions to the destination endpoints. The PRIV bit and
PRIVID bit in the channel options parameter (OPT) is set with the EDMA3 programmer's PRIV value and
PRIVID values, respectively, when any part of the PaRAM set is written.
The PRIV is the privilege level (i.e., user vs. supervisor). The PRIVID refers to a privilege ID with a
number that is associated with an EDMA3 programmer.
See the data manual for the PRIVIDs that are associated with potential EDMA3 programmers.
These options are part of the TR that are submitted to the transfer controller. The transfer controller uses
the above values on their respective read and write command bus so that the target endpoints can
perform memory protection checks based on these values.
Consider a parameter set that is programmed by a CPU in user privilege level for a simple transfer with
the source buffer on an L2 page and the destination buffer on an L1D page. The PRIV is 0 for user-level
and the CPU has a PRIVID of 0.
The PaRAM set is shown in Figure 11-16.

The PRIV and PRIVID information travels along with the read and write requests that are issued to the
source and destination memories.
For example, if the access attributes that are associated with the L2 page with the source buffer only allow
supervisor read, write accesses (SR,SW), the user-level read request above is refused. Similarly, if the
access attributes that are associated with the L1D page with the destination buffer only allow supervisor
read and write accesses (SR, SW), the user-level write request above is refused. For the transfer to
succeed, the source and destination pages should have user-read and user-write permissions,
respectively, along with allowing accesses from a PRIVID 0.
Because the programmer's privilege level and privilege identification travel with the read and write
requests, EDMA3 acts as a proxy.
Figure 11-18 illustrates the propagation of PRIV and PRIVID at the boundaries of all the interacting
entities (CPU, EDMA3CC, EDMA3TC, and slave memories).

### 11.3.11 Event Queues

Event queues are a part of the EDMA3 channel controller. Event queues form the interface between the
event detection logic in the EDMA3CC and the transfer request (TR) submission logic of the EDMA3CC.
Each queue is 16 entries deep; thus, each event queue can queue a maximum of 16 events. If there are
more than 16 events, then the events that cannot find a place in the event queue remain set in the
associated event register and the CPU does not stall.
There are three event queues for the device: Queue0, Queue1, and Queue2. Events in Queue0 result in
submission of its associated transfer requests (TRs) to TC0. Similarly, transfer requests that are
associated with events in Queue2 are submitted to TC2.
An event that wins prioritization against other DMA and/or QDMA pending events is placed at the tail of
the appropriate event queue. Each event queue is serviced in FIFO order. Once the event reaches the
head of its queue and the corresponding transfer controller is ready to receive another TR, the event is
de-queued and the PaRAM set corresponding to the de-queued event is processed and submitted as a
transfer request packet (TRP) to the associated EDMA3 transfer controller.
Queue0 has highest priority and Queue2 has the lowest priority, if Queue0 and Queue1 both have at least
one event entry and if both TC0 and TC1 can accept transfer requests, then the event in Queue0 is de-
queued first and its associated PaRAM set is processed and submitted as a transfer request (TR) to TC0.
See Section 11.3.11.4 for system-level performance considerations. All of the event entries in all of the
event queues are software readable (not writeable) by accessing the event entry registers (Q0E0,
Q0E1,…Q1E15, etc.). Each event entry register characterizes the queued event in terms of the type of
event (manual, event, chained or auto-triggered) and the event number. See for a description of the bit
fields in the queue event entry registers.


#### 11.3.11.1 DMA/QDMA Channel to Event Queue Mapping

Each of the 64 DMA channels and eight QDMA channels are programmed independently to map to a
specific queue, using the DMA queue number register (DMAQNUM) and the QDMA queue number
register (QDMANUM). The mapping of DMA/QDMA channels is critical to achieving the desired
performance level for the EDMA and most importantly, in meeting real-time deadlines. See
Section 11.3.11.4.


NOTE: If an event is ready to be queued and both the event queue and the EDMA3 transfer
controller that is associated to the event queue are empty, then the event bypasses the
event queue, and moves the PaRAM processing logic, and eventually to the transfer request
submission logic for submission to the EDMA3TC. In this case, the event is not logged in the
event queue status registers.


#### 11.3.11.2 Queue RAM Debug Visibility

There are three event queues and each queue has 16 entries. These 16 entries are managed in a circular
FIFO manner. There is a queue status register (QSTAT) associated with each queue. These along with all
of the 16 entries per queue can be read via registers QSTATn and QxEy, respectively.
These registers provide user visibility and may be helpful while debugging real-time issues (typically post-
mortem), involving multiple events and event sources. The event queue entry register (QxEy) uniquely
identifies the specific event type (event-triggered, manually-triggered, chain-triggered, and QDMA events)
along with the event number (for all DMA/QDMA event channels) that are in the queue or have been de-
queued (passed through the queue).
Each of the 16 entries in the event queue are read using the EDMA3CC memory-mapped register. By
reading the event queue, you see the history of the last 16 TRs that have been processed by the EDMA3
on a given queue. This provides user/software visibility and is helpful for debugging real-time issues
(typically post-mortem), involving multiple events and event sources.
The queue status register (QSTATn) includes fields for the start pointer (STRTPTR) which provides the
offset to the head entry of an event. It also includes a field called NUMVAL that provides the total number
of valid entries residing in the event queue at a given instance of time. The STRTPTR may be used to
index appropriately into the 16 event entries. NUMVAL number of entries starting from STRTPTR are
indicative of events still queued in the respective queue. The remaining entry may be read to determine
what's already de-queued and submitted to the associated transfer controller.


#### 11.3.11.3 Queue Resource Tracking

The EDMA3CC event queue includes watermarking/threshold logic that allows you to keep track of
maximum usage of all event queues. This is useful for debugging real-time deadline violations that may
result from head-of-line blocking on a given EDMA3 event queue.
You can program the maximum number of events that can queue up in an event queue by programming
the threshold value (between 0 to 15) in the queue watermark threshold A register (QWMTHRA). The
maximum queue usage is recorded actively in the watermark (WM) field of the queue status register
(QSTATn) that keeps getting updated based on a comparison of number of valid entries, which is also
visible in the NUMVAL bit in QSTATn and the maximum number of entries (WM bit in QSTATn).
If the queue usage is exceeded, this status is visible in the EDMA3CC registers: the QTHRXCDn bit in the
channel controller error register (CCERR) and the THRXCD bit in QSTATn, where n stands for the event
queue number. Any bits that are set in CCERR also generate an EDMA3CC error interrupt.


#### 11.3.11.4 Performance Considerations

The main system bus infrastructure (L3) arbitrates bus requests from all of the masters (TCs, CPU(S), and
other bus masters) to the shared slave resources (peripherals and memories).
The priorities of transfer requests (read and write commands) from the EDMA3 transfer controllers with
respect to other masters within the system crossbar are programmed using the queue priority register
(QUEPRI). QUEPRI programs the priority of the event queues (or indirectly, TC0-TC2, because QueueN
transfer requests are submitted to TCN).
Therefore, the priority of unloading queues has a secondary affect compared to the priority of the transfers
as they are executed by the EDMA3TC (dictated by the priority set using QUEPRI).


### 11.3.12 EDMA3 Transfer Controller (EDMA3TC)

The EDMA3 channel controller is the user-interface of the EDMA3 and the EDMA3 transfer controller
(EDMA3TC) is the data movement engine of the EDMA3. The EDMA3CC submits transfer requests (TR)
to the EDMA3TC and the EDMA3TC performs the data transfers dictated by the TR; thus, the EDMA3TC
is a slave to the EDMA3CC.


#### 11.3.12.1 Architecture Details


##### 11.3.12.1.1 Command Fragmentation

The TC read and write controllers in conjunction with the source and destination register sets are
responsible for issuing optimally-sized reads and writes to the slave endpoints. An optimally-sized
command is defined by the transfer controller default burst size (DBS), which is defined in
Section 11.3.12.5.
The EDMA3TC attempts to issue the largest possible command size as limited by the DBS value or the
ACNT/BCNT value of the TR. EDMA3TC obeys the following rules:
• The read/write controllers always issue commands less than or equal to the DBS value.
• The first command of a 1D transfer command always aligns the address of subsequent commands to
the DBS value.
Table 11-22 lists the TR segmentation rules that are followed by the EDMA3TC. In summary, if the ACNT
value is larger than the DBS value, then the EDMA3TC breaks the ACNT array into DBS-sized commands
to the source/destination addresses. Each BCNT number of arrays are then serviced in succession.
For BCNT arrays of ACNT bytes (that is, a 2D transfer), if the ACNT value is less than or equal to the
DBS value, then the TR may be optimized into a 1D-transfer in order to maximize efficiency. The
optimization takes place if the EDMA3TC recognizes that the 2D-transfer is organized as a single
dimension (ACNT == BIDX) and the ACNT value is a power of 2.
Table 11-22 lists conditions in which the optimizations are performed.

##### 11.3.12.1.2 TR Pipelining

TR pipelining refers to the ability of the source active set to proceed ahead of the destination active set.
Essentially, the reads for a given TR may already be in progress while the writes of a previous TR may
not have completed.
The number of outstanding TRs is limited by the number of destination FIFO register entries.
TR pipelining is useful for maintaining throughput on back-to-back small TRs. It minimizes the startup
overhead because reads start in the background of a previous TR writes.


Example 11-4. Command Fragmentation (DBS = 64)

The pseudo code:
1. ACNT = 8, BCNT = 8, SRCBIDX = 8, DSTBIDX = 10, SRCADDR = 64, DSTADDR = 191
Read Controller: This is optimized from a 2D-transfer to a 1D-transfer such that the read side is equivalent
to ACNT = 64, BCNT = 1.
Cmd0 = 64 byte
Write Controller: Because DSTBIDX != ACNT, it is not optimized.
Cmd0 = 8 byte, Cmd1 = 8 byte, Cmd2 = 8 byte, Cmd3 = 8 byte, Cmd4 = 8 byte, Cmd5 = 8 byte, Cmd6 = 8
byte, Cmd7 = 8 byte.
2. ACNT=128, BCNT = 1,SRCADDR = 63, DSTADDR = 513
Read Controller: Read address is not aligned.
Cmd0 = 1 byte, (now the SRCADDR is aligned to 64 for the next command)
Cmd1 = 64 bytes
Cmd2 = 63 bytes
Write Controller: The write address is also not aligned.
Cmd0 = 63 bytes, (now the DSTADDR is aligned to 64 for the next command)
Cmd1 = 64 bytes
Cmd2 = 1 byte


##### 11.3.12.1.3 Performance Tuning

By default, reads are as issued as fast as possible. In some cases, the reads issued by the EDMA3TC
could fill the available command buffering for a slave, delaying other (potentially higher priority) masters
from successfully submitting commands to that slave. The rate at which read commands are issued by the
EDMA3TC is controlled by the RDRATE register. The RDRATE register defines the number of cycles that
the EDMA3TC read controller waits before issuing subsequent commands for a given TR, thus minimizing
the chance of the EDMA3TC consuming all available slave resources. The RDRATE value should be set
to a relatively small value if the transfer controller is targeted for high priority transfers and to a higher
value if the transfer controller is targeted for low priority transfers.
In contrast, the Write Interface does not have any performance turning knobs because writes always have
an interval between commands as write commands are submitted along with the associated write data.


#### 11.3.12.2 Memory Protection

The transfer controller plays an important role in handling proxy memory protection. There are two access
properties associated with a transfer: for instance, the privilege id (system-wide identification assigned to a
master) of the master initiating the transfer, and the privilege level (user versus supervisor) used to
program the transfer. This information is maintained in the PaRAM set when it is programmed in the
channel controller. When a TR is submitted to the transfer controller, this information is made available to
the EDMA3TC and used by the EDMA3TC while issuing read and write commands. The read or write
commands have the same privilege identification, and privilege level as that programmed in the EDMA3
transfer in the channel controller.


#### 11.3.12.3 Error Generation

Errors are generated if enabled under three conditions:
• EDMA3TC detection of an error signaled by the source or destination address.
• Attempt to read or write to an invalid address in the configuration memory map.
• Detection of a constant addressing mode TR violating the constant addressing mode transfer rules (the
source/destination addresses and source/destination indexes must be aligned to 32 bytes).


Either or all error types may be disabled. If an error bit is set and enabled, the error interrupt for the
concerned transfer controller is pulsed.


#### 11.3.12.4 Debug Features

The DMA program register set, DMA source active register set, and the destination FIFO register set are
used to derive a brief history of TRs serviced through the transfer controller.
Additionally, the EDMA3TC status register (TCSTAT) has dedicated bit fields to indicate the ongoing
activity within different parts of the transfer controller:
• The SRCACTV bit indicates whether the source active set is active.
• The DSTACTV bit indicates the number of TRs resident in the destination register active set at a given
instance.
• The PROGBUSY bit indicates whether a valid TR is present in the DMA program set.
If the TRs are in progression, caution must be used and you must realize that there is a chance that the
values read from the EDMA3TC status registers will be inconsistent since the EDMA3TC may change the
values of these registers due to ongoing activities.
It is recommended that you ensure no additional submission of TRs to the EDMA3TC in order to facilitate
ease of debug.


##### 11.3.12.4.1 Destination FIFO Register Pointer

The destination FIFO register pointer is implemented as a circular buffer with the start pointer being
DFSTRTPTR and a buffer depth of usually 2 or 4. The EDMA3TC maintains two important status details in
TCSTAT that may be used during advanced debugging, if necessary. The DFSTRTPTR is a start pointer,
that is, the index to the head of the destination FIFO register. The DSTACTV is a counter for the number
of valid (occupied) entries. These registers may be used to get a brief history of transfers.
Examples of some register field values and their interpretation:
• DFSTRTPTR = 0 and DSTACTV = 0 implies that no TRs are stored in the destination FIFO register.
• DFSTRTPTR = 1 and DSTACTV = 2h implies that two TRs are present. The first pending TR is read
from the destination FIFO register entry 1 and the second pending TR is read from the destination
FIFO register entry 2.
• DFSTRTPTR = 3h and DSTACTV = 2h implies that two TRs are present. The first pending TR is read
from the destination FIFO register entry 3 and the second pending TR is read from the destination
FIFO register entry 0.


#### 11.3.12.5 EDMA3TC Configuration

Table 11-23 provides the configuration of the individual EDMA3 transfer controllers present on the device.
The default burst size (DBS) for each transfer controller is configurable using the TPTC_CFG register in
the control module.

### 11.3.13 Event Dataflow

This section summarizes the data flow of a single event, from the time the event is latched to the channel
controller to the time the transfer completion code is returned. The following steps list the sequence of
EDMA3CC activity:
1. Event is asserted from an external source (peripheral or external interrupt). This also is similar for a
manually-triggered, chained-triggered, or QDMA-triggered event. The event is latched into the
ER.En/ERH.En (or CER.En/CERH.En, ESR.En /ESRH.En, QER.En) bit.
2. Once an event is prioritized and queued into the appropriate event queue, the SER.En\SERH.En (or
QSER.En) bit is set to inform the event prioritization/processing logic to disregard this event since it is
already in the queue. Alternatively, if the transfer controller and the event queue are empty, then the
event bypasses the queue.
3. The EDMA3CC processing and the submission logic evaluates the appropriate PaRAM set and
determines whether it is a non-null and non-dummy transfer request (TR).
4. The EDMA3CC clears the ER.En/ERH.En (or CER.En/CERH.En, ESR.En/ESRH.En, QER.En) bit and
the SER.En/SERH.En bit as soon as it determines the TR is non-null. In the case of a null set, the
SER.En/SERH.En bit remains set. It submits the non-null/non-dummy TR to the associated transfer
controller. If the TR was programmed for early completion, the EDMA3CC immediately sets the
interrupt pending register (IPR.I[TCC]/IPRH.I[TCC]-32).
5. If the TR was programmed for normal completion, the EDMA3CC sets the interrupt pending register
(IPR.I[TCC]/IPRH.I[TCC]) when the EDMA3TC informs the EDMA3CC about completion of the transfer
(returns transfer completion codes).
6. The EDMA3CC programs the associated EDMA3TCn's Program Register Set with the TR.
7. The TR is then passed to the Source Active set and the DST FIFO Register Set, if both the register
sets are available.
8. The Read Controller processes the TR by issuing read commands to the source slave endpoint. The
Read Data lands in the Data FIFO of the EDMA3TCn.
9. As soon as sufficient data is available, the Write Controller begins processing the TR by issuing write
commands to the destination slave endpoint.
10. This continues until the TR completes and the EDMA3TCn then signals completion status to the
EDMA3CC.


### 11.3.14 EDMA3 Prioritization

The EDMA3 controller has many implementation rules to deal with concurrent events/channels, transfers,
etc. The following subsections detail various arbitration details whenever there might be occurrence of
concurrent activity. Figure 11-19 shows the different places EDMA3 priorities come into play.


#### 11.3.14.1 Channel Priority

The DMA event registers (ER and ERH) capture up to 64 events; likewise, the QDMA event register
(QER) captures QDMA events for all QDMA channels; therefore, it is possible for events to occur
simultaneously on the DMA/QDMA event inputs. For events arriving simultaneously, the event associated
with the lowest channel number is prioritized for submission to the event queues (for DMA events, channel
0 has the highest priority and channel 63 has the lowest priority; similarly, for QDMA events, channel 0
has the highest priority and channel 7 has the lowest priority). This mechanism only sorts simultaneous
events for submission to the event queues.
If a DMA and QDMA event occurs simultaneously, the DMA event always has prioritization against the
QDMA event for submission to the event queues.


#### 11.3.14.2 Trigger Source Priority

If a DMA channel is associated with more than one trigger source (event trigger, manual trigger, and chain
trigger), and if multiple events are set simultaneously for the same channel (ER.En = 1, ESR.En = 1 ,
CER.En = 1) , then the EDMA3CC always services these events in the following priority order: event
trigger (via ER) is higher priority than chain trigger (via CER) and chain trigger is higher priority than
manual trigger (via ESR).
This implies that if for channel 0, both ER.E0 = 1 and CER.E0 = 1 at the same time, then the ER.E0 event
is always queued before the CER.E0 event.


#### 11.3.14.3 Dequeue Priority

The priority of the associated transfer request (TR) is further mitigated by which event queue is being used
for event submission (dictated by DMAQNUM and QDMAQNUM). For submission of a TR to the transfer
request, events need to be de-queued from the event queues. Queue 0 has the highest dequeue priority
and Queue 2 the lowest.


#### 11.3.14.4 System (Transfer Controller) Priority

INIT_PRIORITY_0 and INIT_PRIORITY_1 registers in the chip configuration module are used to configure
the EDMA TC's priority through the system bus infrastructure.


NOTE: The default priority for all TCs is the same, 0 or highest priority relative to other masters. It is
recommended that this priority be changed based on system level considerations, such as
real-time deadlines for all masters including the priority of the transfer controllers with respect
to each other.


### 11.3.15 EDMA3 Operating Frequency (Clock Control)

The EDMA3 channel controller and transfer controller are clocked from PLL_L3 SYSCLK4. The EDMA3
system runs at the L3 clock frequency.


### 11.3.16 Reset Considerations

A hardware reset resets the EDMA3 (EDMA3CC and EDMA3TC) and the EDMA3 configuration registers.
The PaRAM memory contents are undefined after device reset and you should not rely on parameters to
be reset to a known state. The PaRAM entry must be initialized to a desired value before it is used.


### 11.3.17 Power Management

The EDMA3 (EDMA3CC and EDMA3TC) can be placed in reduced-power modes to conserve power
during periods of low activity. The power management of the peripheral is controlled by the power reset
clock management (PRCM). The PRCM acts as a master controller for power management for all
peripherals on the device.
The EDMA3 controller can be idled on receiving a clock stop request from the PRCM. The requests to
EDMA3CC and EDMA3TC are separate. In general, it should be verified that there are no pending
activities in the EDMA3 controller


### 11.3.18 Emulation Considerations

During debug when using the emulator, the CPU(s) may be halted on an execute packet boundary for
single-stepping, benchmarking, profiling, or other debug purposes. During an emulation halt, the EDMA3
channel controller and transfer controller operations continue. Events continue to be latched and
processed and transfer requests continue to be submitted and serviced.


Since EDMA3 is involved in servicing multiple master and slave peripherals, it is not feasible to have an
independent behavior of the EDMA3 for emulation halts. EDMA3 functionality would be coupled with the
peripherals it is servicing, which might have different behavior during emulation halts. For example, if a
McASP is halted during an emulation access (FREE = 0 and SOFT = 0 or 1 in McASP registers), the
McASP stops generating the McASP receive or transmit events (REVT or XEVT) to the EDMA. From the
point of view of the McASP, the EDMA3 is suspended, but other peripherals (for example, a timer) still
assert events and will be serviced by the EDMA.

### 11.3.19 EDMA Transfer Examples

The EDMA3 channel controller performs a variety of transfers depending on the parameter configuration.
The following sections provide a description and PaRAM configuration for some typical use case
scenarios.


#### 11.3.19.1 Block Move Example

The most basic transfer performed by the EDMA3 is a block move. During device operation it is often
necessary to transfer a block of data from one location to another, usually between on-chip and off-chip
memory.
In this example, a section of data is to be copied from external memory to internal L2 SRAM as shown in

**Figure 11-20. Figure 11-21 shows the parameters for this transfer.**

The source address for the transfer is set to the start of the data block in external memory, and the
destination address is set to the start of the data block in L2. If the data block is less than 64K bytes, the
PaRAM configuration shown in Figure 11-21 holds true with the synchronization type set to A-
synchronized and indexes cleared to 0. If the amount of data is greater than 64K bytes, BCNT and the B-
indexes need to be set appropriately with the synchronization type set to AB-synchronized. The STATIC
bit in OPT is set to prevent linking.
This transfer example may also be set up using QDMA. For successive transfer submissions, of a similar
nature, the number of cycles used to submit the transfer are fewer depending on the number of changing
transfer parameters. You may program the QDMA trigger word to be the highest numbered offset in the
PaRAM set that undergoes change.

#### 11.3.19.2 Subframe Extraction Example

The EDMA3 can efficiently extract a small frame of data from a larger frame of data. By performing a 2D-
to-1D transfer, the EDMA3 retrieves a portion of data for the CPU to process. In this example, a
640 × 480-pixel frame of video data is stored in external memory. Each pixel is represented by a 16-bit
halfword. The CPU extracts a 16 × 12-pixel subframe of the image for processing. To facilitate more
efficient processing time by the CPU, the EDMA3 places the subframe in internal L2 SRAM. Figure 11-22
shows the transfer of a subframe from external memory to L2. Figure 11-23 shows the parameters for this
transfer.
The same PaRAM entry options are used for QDMA channels, as well as DMA channels. The STATIC bit
in OPT is set to prevent linking. For successive transfers, only changed parameters need to be
programmed before triggering the channel.

#### 11.3.19.3 Data Sorting Example

Many applications require the use of multiple data arrays; it is often desirable to have the arrays arranged
such that the first elements of each array are adjacent, the second elements are adjacent, and so on.
Often this is not how the data is presented to the device. Either data is transferred via a peripheral with
the data arrays arriving one after the other or the arrays are located in memory with each array occupying
a portion of contiguous memory spaces. For these instances, the EDMA3 can reorganize the data into the
desired format. Figure 11-24 shows the data sorting.
To determine the parameter set values, the following need to be considered:
• ACNT - Program this to be the size in bytes of an element.
• BCNT - Program this to be the number of elements in a frame.
• CCNT - Program this to be the number of frames.
• SRCBIDX - Program this to be the size of the element or ACNT.
• DSTBIDX - CCNT × ACNT
• SRCCDX - ACNT × BCNT
• DSTCIDX - ACNT
The synchronization type needs to be AB-synchronized and the STATIC bit is 0 to allow updates to the
parameter set. It is advised to use normal EDMA3 channels for sorting.
It is not possible to sort this with a single trigger event. Instead, the channel can be programmed to be
chained to itself. After BCNT elements get sorted, intermediate chaining could be used to trigger the
channel again causing the transfer of the next BCNT elements and so on. Figure 11-25 shows the
parameter set programming for this transfer, assuming channel 0 and an element size of 4 bytes.

#### 11.3.19.4 Peripheral Servicing Example

The EDMA3 channel controller also services peripherals in the background of CPU operation, without
requiring any CPU intervention. Through proper initialization of the EDMA3 channels, they can be
configured to continuously service on-chip and off-chip peripherals throughout the device operation. Each
event available to the EDMA3 has its own dedicated channel, and all channels operate simultaneously.
The only requirements are to use the proper channel for a particular transfer and to enable the channel
event in the event enable register (EER). When programming an EDMA3 channel to service a peripheral,
it is necessary to know how data is to be presented to the processor. Data is always provided with some
kind of synchronization event as either one element per event (non-bursting) or multiple elements per
event (bursting).


##### 11.3.19.4.1 Non-bursting Peripherals

Non-bursting peripherals include the on-chip multichannel audio serial port (McASP) and many external
devices, such as codecs. Regardless of the peripheral, the EDMA3 channel configuration is the same.
The McASP transmit and receive data streams are treated independently by the EDMA3. The transmit
and receive data streams can have completely different counts, data sizes, and formats. Figure 11-26
shows servicing incoming McASP data.
To transfer the incoming data stream to its proper location in DDR memory, the EDMA3 channel must be
set up for a 1D-to-1D transfer with A-synchronization. Because an event (AREVT) is generated for every
word as it arrives, it is necessary to have the EDMA3 issue the transfer request for each element
individually. Figure 11-27 shows the parameters for this transfer. The source address of the EDMA3
channel is set to the data port address (DAT) for McASP, and the destination address is set to the start of
the data block in DDR. Because the address of serializer buffer is fixed, the source B index is cleared to 0
(no modification) and the destination B index is set to 01b (increment).
Based on the premise that serial data is typically a high priority, the EDMA3 channel should be
programmed to be on queue 0.

##### 11.3.19.4.2 Bursting Peripherals

Higher bandwidth applications require that multiple data elements be presented to the processor core for
every synchronization event. This frame of data can either be from multiple sources that are working
simultaneously or from a single high-throughput peripheral that streams data to/from the processor.
In this example, a port is receiving a video frame from a camera and presenting it to the processor one
array at a time. The video image is 640 × 480 pixels, with each pixel represented by a 16-bit element. The
image is to be stored in external memory. Figure 11-28 shows this example.
To transfer data from an external peripheral to an external buffer one array at a time based on EVTn ,
channel n must be configured. Due to the nature of the data (a video frame made up of arrays of pixels)
the destination is essentially a 2D entity. Figure 11-29 shows the parameters to service the incoming data
with a 1D-to-2D transfer using AB-synchronization. The source address is set to the location of the video
framer peripheral, and the destination address is set to the start of the data buffer. Because the input
address is static, the SRCBIDX is 0 (no modification to the source address). The destination is made up of
arrays of contiguous, linear elements; therefore, the DSTBIDX is set to pixel size, 2 bytes. ANCT is equal
to the pixel size, 2 bytes. BCNT is set to the number of pixels in an array, 640. CCNT is equal to the total
number of arrays in the block, 480. SRCCIDX is 0 because the source address undergoes no increment.
The DSTCIDX is equal to the difference between the starting addresses of each array. Because a pixel is
16 bits (2 bytes), DSTCIDX is equal to 640 × 2.

##### 11.3.19.4.3 Continuous Operation

Configuring an EDMA3 channel to receive a single frame of data is useful, and is applicable to some
systems. A majority of the time, however, data is going to be continuously transmitted and received
throughout the entire operation of the processor. In this case, it is necessary to implement some form of
linking such that the EDMA3 channels continuously reload the necessary parameter sets. In this example,
McASP is configured to transmit and receive data on a T1 array. To simplify the example, only two
channels are active for both transmit and receive data streams. Each channel receives packets of
128 elements. The packets are transferred from the serial port to internal memory and from internal
memory to the serial port, as shown Figure 11-30.
The McASP generates AREVT for every element received and generates AXEVT for every element
transmitted. To service the data streams, the DMA channels associated with the McASP must be setup for
1D-to-1D transfers with A-synchronization.
Figure 11-31 shows the parameter entries for the channel for these transfers. To service the McASP
continuously, the channels must be linked to a duplicate PaRAM set in the PaRAM. After all frames have
been transferred, the EDMA3 channels reload and continue. Figure 11-32 shows the reload parameters
for the channel.


##### 11.3.19.4.3.1 Receive Channel

EDMA3 channel 15 services the incoming data stream of McASP. The source address is set to that of the
receive serializer buffer, and the destination address is set to the first element of the data block. Because
there are two data channels being serviced, A and B, they are to be located separately within the L2
SRAM.
To facilitate continuous operation, a copy of the PaRAM set for the channel is placed in PaRAM set 64.
The LINK option is set and the link address is provided in the PaRAM set. Upon exhausting the channel
15 parameter set, the parameters located at the link address are loaded into the channel 15 parameter set
and operation continues. This function continues throughout device operation until halted by the CPU.


##### 11.3.19.4.3.2 Transmit Channel

EDMA3 channel 12 services the outgoing data stream of McASP. In this case the destination address
needs no update, hence, the parameter set changes accordingly. Linking is also used to allow continuous
operation by the EDMA3 channel, with duplicate PaRAM set entries at PaRAM set 65.

##### 11.3.19.4.4 Ping-Pong Buffering

Although the previous configuration allows the EDMA3 to service a peripheral continuously, it presents a
number of restrictions to the CPU. Because the input and output buffers are continuously being
filled/emptied, the CPU must match the pace of the EDMA3 very closely to process the data. The EDMA3
receive data must always be placed in memory before the CPU accesses it, and the CPU must provide
the output data before the EDMA3 transfers it. Though not impossible, this is an unnecessary challenge. It
is particularly difficult in a 2-level cache scheme.
Ping-pong buffering is a simple technique that allows the CPU activity to be distanced from the EDMA3
activity. This means that there are multiple (usually two) sets of data buffers for all incoming and outgoing
data streams. While the EDMA3 transfers the data into and out of the ping buffers, the CPU manipulates
the data in the pong buffers. When both CPU and EDMA3 activity completes, they switch. The EDMA3
then writes over the old input data and transfers the new output data. Figure 11-33 shows the ping-pong
scheme for this example.
To change the continuous operation example, such that a ping-pong buffering scheme is used, the
EDMA3 channels need only a moderate change. Instead of one parameter set, there are two; one for
transferring data to/from the ping buffers and one for transferring data to/from the pong buffers. As soon
as one transfer completes, the channel loads the PaRAM set for the other and the data transfers continue.
Figure 11-34 shows the EDMA3 channel configuration required.
Each channel has two parameter sets, ping and pong. The EDMA3 channel is initially loaded with the ping
parameters (Figure 11-34). The link address for the ping set is set to the PaRAM offset of the pong
parameter set (Figure 11-35). The link address for the pong set is set to the PaRAM offset of the ping
parameter set (Figure 11-36). The channel options, count values, and index values are all identical
between the ping and pong parameters for each channel. The only differences are the link address
provided and the address of the data buffer.


##### 11.3.19.4.4.1 Synchronization with the CPU

To utilize the ping-pong buffering technique, the system must signal the CPU when to begin to access the
new data set. After the CPU finishes processing an input buffer (ping), it waits for the EDMA3 to complete
before switching to the alternate (pong) buffer. In this example, both channels provide their channel
numbers as their report word and set the TCINTEN bit to generate an interrupt after completion. When
channel 15 fills an input buffer, the E15 bit in the interrupt pending register (IPR) is set; when channel 12
empties an output buffer, the E12 bit in IPR is set. The CPU must manually clear these bits. With the
channel parameters set, the CPU polls IPR to determine when to switch. The EDMA3 and CPU could
alternatively be configured such that the channel completion interrupts the CPU. By doing this, the CPU
could service a background task while waiting for the EDMA3 to complete.

##### 11.3.19.4.5 Transfer Chaining Examples

The following examples explain the intermediate transfer complete chaining function.


##### 11.3.19.4.5.1 Servicing Input/Output FIFOs with a Single Event

Many systems require the use of a pair of external FIFOs that must be serviced at the same rate. One
FIFO buffers data input, and the other buffers data output. The EDMA3 channels that service these FIFOs
can be set up for AB-synchronized transfers. While each FIFO is serviced with a different set of
parameters, both can be signaled from a single event. For example, an external interrupt pin can be tied
to the status flags of one of the FIFOs. When this event arrives, the EDMA3 needs to perform servicing for
both the input and output streams. Without the intermediate transfer complete chaining feature this would
require two events, and thus two external interrupt pins. The intermediate transfer complete chaining
feature allows the use of a single external event (for example, a GPIO event). Figure 11-37 shows the
EDMA3 setup and illustration for this example.
A GPIO event (in this case, GPINT0) triggers an array transfer. Upon completion of each intermediate
array transfer of channel 48, intermediate transfer complete chaining sets the E8 bit (specified by TCC of
8) in the chained event register (CER) and provides a synchronization event to channel 8. Upon
completion of the last array transfer of channel 48, transfer complete chaining—not intermediate transfer
complete chaining—sets the E8 bit in CER (specified by TCCMODE:TCC) and provides a synchronization
event to channel 8. The completion of channel 8 sets the I8 bit (specified by TCCMODE:TCC) in the
interrupt pending register (IPR), which can generate an interrupt to the CPU, if the I8 bit in the interrupt
enable register (IER) is set.

OPT.TCC = 01000b


##### 11.3.19.4.5.2 Breaking Up Large Transfers with Intermediate Chaining

Another feature of intermediate transfer chaining (ITCCHEN) is for breaking up large transfers. A large
transfer may lock out other transfers of the same priority level for the duration of the transfer. For example,
a large transfer on queue 0 from the internal memory to the external memory using the EMIF may starve
other EDMA3 transfers on the same queue. In addition, this large high-priority transfer may prevent the
EMIF for a long duration to service other lower priority transfers. When a large transfer is considered to be
high priority, it should be split into multiple smaller transfers. Figure 11-38 shows the EDMA3 setup and
illustration of an example single large block transfer.

1D transfer of 16 KByte elements


The intermediate transfer chaining enable (ITCCHEN) provides a method to break up a large transfer into
smaller transfers. For example, to move a single large block of memory (16K bytes), the EDMA3 performs
an A-synchronized transfer. The element count is set to a reasonable value, where reasonable derives
from the amount of time it would take to move this smaller amount of data. Assume 1 Kbyte is a
reasonable small transfer in this example. The EDMA3 is set up to transfer 16 arrays of 1 Kbyte elements,
for a total of 16K byte elements. The TCC field in the channel options parameter (OPT) is set to the same
value as the channel number and ITCCHEN are set. In this example, EDMA3 channel 25 is used and
TCC is also set to 25. The TCINTEN may also be set to trigger interrupt 25 when the last 1 Kbyte array is
transferred. The CPU starts the EDMA3 transfer by writing to the appropriate bit of the event set register
(ESR.E25). The EDMA3 transfers the first 1 Kbyte array. Upon completion of the first array, intermediate
transfer complete code chaining generates a synchronization event to channel 25, a value specified by the
TCC field. This intermediate transfer completion chaining event causes EDMA3 channel 25 to transfer the
next 1 Kbyte array. This process continues until the transfer parameters are exhausted, at which point the
EDMA3 has completed the 16K byte transfer. This method breaks up a large transfer into smaller packets,
thus providing natural time slices in the transfer such that other events may be processed. Figure 11-39
shows the EDMA3 setup and illustration of the broken up smaller packet transfers.

#### 11.4.1.5 QCHMAP_0 to QCHMAP_7 Register (offset = 200h to 21Ch) [reset = 0h]

QCHMAP_0 to QCHMAP_7 is shown in Figure 11-44 and described in Table 11-31.
Each QDMA channel in EDMA3CC can be associated with any PaRAM set available on the device.
Furthermore, the specific trigger word (0-7) of the PaRAM set can be programmed. The PaRAM set
association and trigger word for every QDMA channel register is configurable using the QDMA channel
map register (QCHMAPn). At reset the QDMA channel map registers for all QDMA channels point to
PaRAM set 0. If an application makes use of both a DMA channel that points to PaRAM set 0 and any
QDMA channels, ensure that QCHMAP is programmed appropriately to point to a different PaRAM entry.

#### 11.4.1.6 DMAQNUM_0 to DMAQNUM_7 Register (offset = 240h to 25Ch) [reset = 0h]

DMAQNUM_0 to DMAQNUM_7 is shown in Figure 11-45 and described in Table 11-32.
The DMA channel queue number register (DMAQNUMn) allows programmability of each of the 64 DMA
channels in the EDMA3CC to submit its associated synchronization event to any event queue in the
EDMA3CC. At reset, all channels point to event queue 0. Because the event queues in EDMA3CC have a
fixed association to the transfer controllers, that is, Q0 TRs are submitted to TC0, Q1 TRs are submitted
to TC1, etc., by programming DMAQNUM for a particular DMA channel also dictates which transfer
controller is utilized for the data movement (or which EDMA3TC receives the TR request).

#### 11.4.1.8 QUEPRI Register (offset = 284h) [reset = 777h]

QUEPRI is shown in Figure 11-47 and described in Table 11-34.
The queue priority register (QUEPRI) allows you to change the priority of the individual queues and the
priority of the transfer request (TR) associated with the events queued in the queue. Because the queue to
EDMA3TC mapping is fixed, programming QUEPRI essentially governs the priority of the associated
transfer controller(s) read/write commands with respect to the other bus masters in the device. You can
modify the EDMA3TC priority to obtain the desired system performance.

#### 11.4.1.9 EMR Register (offset = 300h) [reset = 0h]

EMR is shown in Figure 11-48 and described in Table 11-35.
For a particular DMA channel, if a second event is received prior to the first event getting cleared/serviced,
the bit corresponding to that channel is set/asserted in the event missed registers (EMR/EMRH). All
trigger types are treated individually, that is, manual triggered (ESR/ESRH), chain triggered (CER/CERH),
and event triggered (ER/ERH) are all treated separately. The EMR/EMRH bits for a channel are also set if
an event on that channel encounters a NULL entry (or a NULL TR is serviced). If any EMR/EMRH bit is
set (and all errors, including bits in other error registers (QEMR, CCERR) were previously cleared), the
EDMA3CC generates an error interrupt. For details on EDMA3CC error interrupt generation, see Error
Interrupts. This register is part of a set of registers that provide information on missed DMA and/or QDMA
events, and instances when event queue thresholds are exceeded. If any of the bits in these registers is
set, it results in the EDMA3CC generating an error interrupt.

#### 11.4.1.10 EMRH Register (offset = 304h) [reset = 0h]

EMRH is shown in Figure 11-49 and described in Table 11-36.
For a particular DMA channel, if a second event is received prior to the first event getting cleared/serviced,
the bit corresponding to that channel is set/asserted in the event missed registers (EMR/EMRH). All
trigger types are treated individually, that is, manual triggered (ESR/ESRH), chain triggered (CER/CERH),

0h = No missed event.
1h = Missed event occurred.


#### 11.4.1.11 EMCR Register (offset = 308h) [reset = 0h]

EMCR is shown in Figure 11-50 and described in Table 11-37.
Once a missed event is posted in the event missed registers (EMR/EMRH), the bit remains set and you
need to clear the set bit(s). This is done by way of CPU writes to the event missed clear registers
(EMCR/EMCRH). Writing a 1 to any of the bits clears the corresponding missed event (bit) in EMR/EMRH;
writing a 0 has no effect. This register is part of a set of registers that provide information on missed DMA
and/or QDMA events, and instances when event queue thresholds are exceeded. If any of the bits in
these registers is set, it results in the EDMA3CC generating an error interrupt.

1h = Corresponding missed event bit in the event missed register
(EMR) is cleared (En = 0).


#### 11.4.1.12 EMCRH Register (offset = 30Ch) [reset = 0h]

EMCRH is shown in Figure 11-51 and described in Table 11-38.
Once a missed event is posted in the event missed registers (EMR/EMRH), the bit remains set and you
need to clear the set bit(s). This is done by way of CPU writes to the event missed clear registers
(EMCR/EMCRH). Writing a 1 to any of the bits clears the corresponding missed event (bit) in EMR/EMRH;

#### 11.4.1.13 QEMR Register (offset = 310h) [reset = 0h]

QEMR is shown in Figure 11-52 and described in Table 11-39.
For a particular QDMA channel, if two QDMA events are detected without the first event getting
cleared/serviced, the bit corresponding to that channel is set/asserted in the QDMA event missed register
(QEMR). The QEMR bits for a channel are also set if a QDMA event on the channel encounters a NULL
entry (or a NULL TR is serviced). If any QEMR bit is set (and all errors, including bits in other error
registers (EMR/EMRH, CCERR) were previously cleared), the EDMA3CC generates an error interrupt. For
details on EDMA3CC error interrupt generation, see Error Interrupts. This register is part of a set of
registers that provide information on missed DMA and/or QDMA events, and instances when event queue

1h = Missed event occurred.


#### 11.4.1.14 QEMCR Register (offset = 314h) [reset = 0h]

QEMCR is shown in Figure 11-53 and described in Table 11-40.
Once a missed event is posted in the QDMA event missed registers (QEMR), the bit remains set and you
need to clear the set bit(s). This is done by way of CPU writes to the QDMA event missed clear registers
(QEMCR). Writing a 1 to any of the bits clears the corresponding missed event (bit) in QEMR; writing a 0
has no effect. This register is part of a set of registers that provide information on missed DMA and/or
QDMA events, and instances when event queue thresholds are exceeded. If any of the bits in these
registers is set, it results in the EDMA3CC generating an error interrupt.

#### 11.4.1.15 CCERR Register (offset = 318h) [reset = 0h]

CCERR is shown in Figure 11-54 and described in Table 11-41.
The EDMA3CC error register (CCERR) indicates whether or not at any instant of time the number of
events queued up in any of the event queues exceeds or equals the threshold/watermark value that is set
in the queue watermark threshold register (QWMTHRA). Additionally, CCERR also indicates if when the
number of outstanding TRs that have been programmed to return transfer completion code (TRs which
have the TCINTEN or TCCHEN bit in OPT set) to the EDMA3CC has exceeded the maximum allowed
value of 63. If any bit in CCERR is set (and all errors, including bits in other error registers (EMR/EMRH,
QEMR) were previously cleared), the EDMA3CC generates an error interrupt. For details on EDMA3CC
error interrupt generation, see Error Interrupts. Once the error bits are set in CCERR, they can only be
cleared by writing to the corresponding bits in the EDMA3CC error clear register (CCERRCLR). This
register is part of a set of registers that provide information on missed DMA and/or QDMA events, and
instances when event queue thresholds are exceeded. If any of the bits in these registers is set, it results
in the EDMA3CC generating an error interrupt.

#### 11.4.1.16 CCERRCLR Register (offset = 31Ch) [reset = 0h]

CCERRCLR is shown in Figure 11-55 and described in Table 11-42.
The EDMA3CC error clear register (CCERRCLR) is used to clear any error bits that are set in the
EDMA3CC error register (CCERR). In addition, CCERRCLR also clears the values of some bit fields in
the queue status registers (QSTATn) associated with a particular event queue. Writing a 1 to any of the
bits clears the corresponding bit in CCERR; writing a 0 has no effect. This register is part of a set of
registers that provide information on missed DMA and/or QDMA events, and instances when event queue
thresholds are exceeded. If any of the bits in these registers is set, it results in the EDMA3CC generating
an error interrupt.

#### 11.4.1.17 EEVAL Register (offset = 320h) [reset = 0h]

EEVAL is shown in Figure 11-56 and described in Table 11-43.
The EDMA3CC error interrupt is asserted whenever an error bit is set in any of the error registers
(EMR/EMRH, QEMR, and CCERR). For subsequent error bits that get set, the EDMA3CC error interrupt
is reasserted only when transitioning from an all the error bits cleared to at least one error bit is set .
Alternatively, a CPU write of 1 to the EVAL bit in the error evaluation register (EEVAL) results in
reasserting the EDMA3CC error interrupt, if there are any outstanding error bits set due to subsequent
error conditions. Writes of 0 have no effect. This register is part of a set of registers that provide
information on missed DMA and/or QDMA events, and instances when event queue thresholds are
exceeded. If any of the bits in these registers is set, it results in the EDMA3CC generating an error
interrupt.

#### 11.4.1.32 DRAE7 Register (offset = 378h) [reset = 0h]

DRAE7 is shown in Figure 11-71 and described in Table 11-58.
The DMA region access enable register for shadow region 7 is programmed to allow or disallow read/write
accesses on a bit-by-bit bases for all DMA registers in the shadow region 7 view of the DMA channel
registers. Additionally, the DRAE7 configuration determines completion of which DMA channels will result
in assertion of the shadow region 7 DMA completion interrupt. The DRAE registers are part of the group of
the region access enable registers, which includes DRAEm and QRAEm. Where m is the number of
shadow regions in the EDMA3CC memory map for a device. You can configure these registers to assign
ownership of DMA/QDMA channels to a particular shadow region.

#### 11.4.1.35 Q0E0 Register (offset = 400h) [reset = 0h]

Q0E0 is shown in Figure 11-74 and described in Table 11-61.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q0E0 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

#### 11.4.1.40 Q0E5 Register (offset = 414h) [reset = 0h]

Q0E5 is shown in Figure 11-79 and described in Table 11-66.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q0E5 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

#### 11.4.1.47 Q0E12 Register (offset = 430h) [reset = 0h]

Q0E12 is shown in Figure 11-86 and described in Table 11-73.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q0E12 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

#### 11.4.1.54 Q1E3 Register (offset = 44Ch) [reset = 0h]

Q1E3 is shown in Figure 11-93 and described in Table 11-80.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q1E3 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

#### 11.4.1.61 Q1E10 Register (offset = 468h) [reset = 0h]

Q1E10 is shown in Figure 11-100 and described in Table 11-87.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q1E10 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

#### 11.4.1.68 Q2E1 Register (offset = 484h) [reset = 0h]

Q2E1 is shown in Figure 11-107 and described in Table 11-94.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q2E1 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

Q2E8 is shown in Figure 11-114 and described in Table 11-101.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q2E8 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q2E14 register provides visibility into the
event queues and a TR life cycle. These are useful for system debug as they provide in-depth visibility for
the events queued up in the event queue and also provide information on what parts of the EDMA3CC
logic are active once the event has been received by the EDMA3CC.

Q2E15 is shown in Figure 11-121 and described in Table 11-108.
The event queue entry registers (QxEy) exist for all 16 queue entries (the maximum allowed queue
entries) for all event queues in the EDMA3CC. The event queue entry registers range from Q0E0 to
Q0E15, Q1E0 to Q1E15, and Q2E0 to Q2E15. Each register details the event number (ENUM) and the
event type (ETYPE). For example, if the value in Q1E4 is read as 000 004Fh, this means the 4th entry in
queue 1 is a manually-triggered event on DMA channel 15. The Q2E15 register provides visibility into the

completion requests submitted to the transfer controllers.
This count increments every time a TR is submitted and is
programmed to report completion (the TCINTEN or TCCCHEN bits
in OPT in the parameter entry associated with the TR are set).
The counter decrements for every valid TCC received back from the
transfer controllers.
If at any time the count reaches a value of 63, the EDMA3CC will not
service any new TRs until the count is less then 63 (or return a
transfer completion code from a transfer controller, which would
decrement the count).
0h = No completion requests outstanding.
1h = Total of 1 completion request to 63 completion requests are
outstanding, from 1h to 3Fh.

#### 11.4.1.91 ER Register (offset = 1000h) [reset = 0h]

ER is shown in Figure 11-130 and described in Table 11-117.
All external events are captured in the event register (ER/ERH). The events are latched even when the
events are not enabled. If the event bit corresponding to the latched event is enabled (EER.En/EERH.En
= 1), then the event is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request submission to
the transfer controllers. The event register bits are automatically cleared (ER.En/ERH.En= 0) once the
corresponding events are prioritized and serviced. If ER.En/ERH.En are already set and another event is
received on the same channel/event, then the corresponding event is latched in the event miss register
(EMR.En/EMRH.En), provided that the event was enabled (EER.En/EERH.En = 1). Event n can be
cleared by the CPU writing a 1 to corresponding event bit in the event clear register (ECR/ECRH). The
setting of an event is a higher priority relative to clear operations (via hardware or software). If set and
clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition wins. If the event was previously set, then
EMR/EMRH would be set because an event is lost. If the event was previously clear, then the event
remains set and is prioritized for submission to the event queues. The Debug List table provides the type
of synchronization events and the EDMA3CC channels associated to each of these external events. This
register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of
a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that each have 64 bits and the bit position of each
register matches the DMA channel number. Each register is named with the format reg_name that
corresponds to DMA channels 0 through 31 and reg_name_High that corresponds to DMA channels 32
through 64. For example, the event register (ER) corresponds to DMA channel 0 through 31 and the event
register high register (ERH) corresponds to DMA channel 32 through 63. The register is typically called
the event register. The DMA channel registers are accessible via read/writes to the global address range.
They are also accessible via read/writes to the shadow address range. The read/write ability to the
registers in the shadow region are controlled by the DMA region access registers (DRAEm/DRAEHm).

Events 0 to 31 are captured by the EDMA3CC and are latched into
ER.
The events are set (En = 1) even when events are disabled (En = 0
in the event enable register, EER).
0h = EDMA3CC event is not asserted.
1h = EDMA3CC event is asserted. Corresponding DMA event is
prioritized versus other pending DMA/QDMA events for submission

#### 11.4.1.92 ERH Register (offset = 1004h) [reset = 0h]

ERH is shown in Figure 11-131 and described in Table 11-118.
All external events are captured in the event register (ER/ERH). The events are latched even when the
events are not enabled. If the event bit corresponding to the latched event is enabled (EER.En/EERH.En
= 1), then the event is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request submission to
the transfer controllers. The event register bits are automatically cleared (ER.En/ERH.En= 0) once the
corresponding events are prioritized and serviced. If ER.En/ERH.En are already set and another event is
received on the same channel/event, then the corresponding event is latched in the event miss register
(EMR.En/EMRH.En), provided that the event was enabled (EER.En/EERH.En = 1). Event n can be
cleared by the CPU writing a 1 to corresponding event bit in the event clear register (ECR/ECRH). The
setting of an event is a higher priority relative to clear operations (via hardware or software). If set and
clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition wins. If the event was previously set, then
EMR/EMRH would be set because an event is lost. If the event was previously clear, then the event

The events are set (En = 1) even when events are disabled (En = 0
in the event enable register high, EERH).

#### 11.4.1.93 ECR Register (offset = 1008h) [reset = 0h]

ECR is shown in Figure 11-132 and described in Table 11-119.
Once an event has been posted in the event registers (ER/ERH), the event is cleared in two ways. If the
event is enabled in the event enable register (EER/EERH) and the EDMA3CC submits a transfer request
for the event to the EDMA3TC, it clears the corresponding event bit in the event register. If the event is
disabled in the event enable register (EER/EERH), the CPU can clear the event by way of the event clear
registers (ECR/ECRH). Writing a 1 to any of the bits clears the corresponding event; writing a 0 has no
effect. Once an event bit is set in the event register, it remains set until EDMA3CC submits a transfer
request for that event or the CPU clears the event by setting the corresponding bit in ECR/ECRH. This
register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of
a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that each have 64 bits and the bit position of each

#### 11.4.1.94 ECRH Register (offset = 100Ch) [reset = 0h]

ECRH is shown in Figure 11-133 and described in Table 11-120.
Once an event has been posted in the event registers (ER/ERH), the event is cleared in two ways. If the
event is enabled in the event enable register (EER/EERH) and the EDMA3CC submits a transfer request
for the event to the EDMA3TC, it clears the corresponding event bit in the event register. If the event is
disabled in the event enable register (EER/EERH), the CPU can clear the event by way of the event clear

#### 11.4.1.95 ESR Register (offset = 1010h) [reset = 0h]

ESR is shown in Figure 11-134 and described in Table 11-121.
The event set registers (ESR/ESRH) allow the CPU (EDMA3 programmers) to manually set events to
initiate DMA transfer requests. CPU writes of 1 to any event set register (En) bits set the corresponding
bits in the registers. The set event is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request
submission to the transfer controllers. Writing a 0 has no effect. The event set registers operate
independent of the event registers (ER/ERH), and a write of 1 is always considered a valid event
regardless of whether the event is enabled (the corresponding event bits are set or cleared in
EER.En/EERH.En). Once the event is set in the event set registers, it cannot be cleared by CPU writes, in
other words, the event clear registers (ECR/ECRH) have no effect on the state of ESR/ESRH. The bits will
only be cleared once the transfer request corresponding to the event has been submitted to the transfer
controller. The setting of an event is a higher priority relative to clear operations (via hardware). If set and
clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition wins. If the event was previously set, then
EMR/EMRH would be set because an event is lost. If the event was previously clear, then the event
remains set and is prioritized for submission to the event queues. Manually-triggered transfers via writes
to ESR/ESRH allow the CPU to submit DMA requests in the system, these are relevant for memory-to-
memory transfer scenarios. If the ESR.En/ESRH.En bit is already set and another CPU write of 1 is
attempted to the same bit, then the corresponding event is latched in the event missed registers
(EMR.En/EMRH.En = 1). This register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels.
The 64 DMA channels consist of a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that each have 64 bits
and the bit position of each register matches the DMA channel number. Each register is named with the

#### 11.4.1.96 ESRH Register (offset = 1014h) [reset = 0h]

ESRH is shown in Figure 11-135 and described in Table 11-122.
The event set registers (ESR/ESRH) allow the CPU (EDMA3 programmers) to manually set events to
initiate DMA transfer requests. CPU writes of 1 to any event set register (En) bits set the corresponding
bits in the registers. The set event is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request
submission to the transfer controllers. Writing a 0 has no effect. The event set registers operate
independent of the event registers (ER/ERH), and a write of 1 is always considered a valid event
regardless of whether the event is enabled (the corresponding event bits are set or cleared in
EER.En/EERH.En). Once the event is set in the event set registers, it cannot be cleared by CPU writes, in
other words, the event clear registers (ECR/ECRH) have no effect on the state of ESR/ESRH. The bits will
only be cleared once the transfer request corresponding to the event has been submitted to the transfer
controller. The setting of an event is a higher priority relative to clear operations (via hardware). If set and
clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition wins. If the event was previously set, then
EMR/EMRH would be set because an event is lost. If the event was previously clear, then the event
remains set and is prioritized for submission to the event queues. Manually-triggered transfers via writes
to ESR/ESRH allow the CPU to submit DMA requests in the system, these are relevant for memory-to-
memory transfer scenarios. If the ESR.En/ESRH.En bit is already set and another CPU write of 1 is
attempted to the same bit, then the corresponding event is latched in the event missed registers
(EMR.En/EMRH.En = 1). This register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels.
The 64 DMA channels consist of a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that each have 64 bits

#### 11.4.1.97 CER Register (offset = 1018h) [reset = 0h]

CER is shown in Figure 11-136 and described in Table 11-123.
When the OPTIONS parameter for a PaRAM entry is programmed to returned a chained completion code
(ITCCHEN = 1 and/or TCCHEN = 1), then the value dictated by the TCC[5:0] (also programmed in OPT)
forces the corresponding event bit to be set in the chained event registers (CER/CERH). The set chained
event is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request submission to the transfer
controllers. This results in a chained-triggered transfer. The chained event registers do not have any
enables. The generation of a chained event is essentially enabled by the PaRAM entry that has been
configured for intermediate and/or final chaining on transfer completion. The En bit is set (regardless of
the state of EER.En/EERH.En) when a chained completion code is returned from one of the transfer
controllers or is generated by the EDMA3CC via the early completion path. The bits in the chained event
register are cleared when the corresponding events are prioritized and serviced. If the En bit is already set
and another chaining completion code is return for the same event, then the corresponding event is
latched in the event missed registers (EMR.En/EMRH.En= 1). The setting of an event is a higher priority
relative to clear operations (via hardware). If set and clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition
wins. If the event was previously set, then EMR/EMRH would be set because an event is lost. If the event
was previously clear, then the event remains set and is prioritized for submission to the event queues.

DMA/QDMA events for submission to the EDMA3TC.


#### 11.4.1.99 EER Register (offset = 1020h) [reset = 0h]

EER is shown in Figure 11-138 and described in Table 11-125.
The EDMA3CC provides the option of selectively enabling/disabling each event in the event registers
(ER/ERH) by using the event enable registers (EER/EERH). If an event bit in EER/EERH is set (using the
event enable set registers, EESR/EESRH), it will enable that corresponding event. Alternatively, if an
event bit in EER/EERH is cleared (using the event enable clear registers, EECR/EECRH), it will disable
the corresponding event. The event registers latch all events that are captured by EDMA3CC, even if the
events are disabled (although EDMA3CC does not process it). Enabling an event with a pending event
already set in the event registers enables the EDMA3CC to process the already set event like any other
new event. The EER/EERH settings do not have any effect on chained events (CER.En/CERH.En= 1) and
manually set events (ESR.En/ESRH.En= 1). This register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64
DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that
each have 64 bits and the bit position of each register matches the DMA channel number. Each register is
named with the format reg_name that corresponds to DMA channels 0 through 31 and reg_name_High
that corresponds to DMA channels 32 through 64. For example, the event register (ER) corresponds to
DMA channel 0 through 31 and the event register high register (ERH) corresponds to DMA channel 32
through 63. The register is typically called the event register. The DMA channel registers are accessible
via read/writes to the global address range. They are also accessible via read/writes to the shadow
address range. The read/write ability to the registers in the shadow region are controlled by the DMA
region access registers (DRAEm/DRAEHm).

#### 11.4.1.100 EERH Register (offset = 1024h) [reset = 0h]

EERH is shown in Figure 11-139 and described in Table 11-126.
The EDMA3CC provides the option of selectively enabling/disabling each event in the event registers
(ER/ERH) by using the event enable registers (EER/EERH). If an event bit in EER/EERH is set (using the
event enable set registers, EESR/EESRH), it will enable that corresponding event. Alternatively, if an
event bit in EER/EERH is cleared (using the event enable clear registers, EECR/EECRH), it will disable
the corresponding event. The event registers latch all events that are captured by EDMA3CC, even if the
events are disabled (although EDMA3CC does not process it). Enabling an event with a pending event
already set in the event registers enables the EDMA3CC to process the already set event like any other
new event. The EER/EERH settings do not have any effect on chained events (CER.En/CERH.En= 1) and
manually set events (ESR.En/ESRH.En= 1). This register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64
DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that
each have 64 bits and the bit position of each register matches the DMA channel number. Each register is
named with the format reg_name that corresponds to DMA channels 0 through 31 and reg_name_High
that corresponds to DMA channels 32 through 64. For example, the event register (ER) corresponds to
DMA channel 0 through 31 and the event register high register (ERH) corresponds to DMA channel 32
through 63. The register is typically called the event register. The DMA channel registers are accessible
via read/writes to the global address range. They are also accessible via read/writes to the shadow

#### 11.4.1.101 EECR Register (offset = 1028h) [reset = 0h]

EECR is shown in Figure 11-140 and described in Table 11-127.
The event enable registers (EER/EERH) cannot be modified by directly writing to them. The intent is to
ease the software burden for the case where multiple tasks are attempting to simultaneously modify these
registers. The event enable clear registers (EECR/EECRH) are used to disable events. Writes of 1 to the
bits in EECR/EECRH clear the corresponding event bits in EER/EERH; writes of 0 have no effect. This
register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of
a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that each have 64 bits and the bit position of each
register matches the DMA channel number. Each register is named with the format reg_name that
corresponds to DMA channels 0 through 31 and reg_name_High that corresponds to DMA channels 32

#### 11.4.1.102 EECRH Register (offset = 102Ch) [reset = 0h]

EECRH is shown in Figure 11-141 and described in Table 11-128.
The event enable registers (EER/EERH) cannot be modified by directly writing to them. The intent is to
ease the software burden for the case where multiple tasks are attempting to simultaneously modify these

#### 11.4.1.103 EESR Register (offset = 1030h) [reset = 0h]

EESR is shown in Figure 11-142 and described in Table 11-129.
The event enable registers (EER/EERH) cannot be modified by directly writing to them. The intent is to
ease the software burden for the case where multiple tasks are attempting to simultaneously modify these
registers. The event enable set registers (EESR/EESRH) are used to enable events. Writes of 1 to the bits
in EESR/EESRH set the corresponding event bits in EER/EERH; writes of 0 have no effect. This register
is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of a set of
registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that each have 64 bits and the bit position of each register
matches the DMA channel number. Each register is named with the format reg_name that corresponds to
DMA channels 0 through 31 and reg_name_High that corresponds to DMA channels 32 through 64. For
example, the event register (ER) corresponds to DMA channel 0 through 31 and the event register high

#### 11.4.1.104 EESRH Register (offset = 1034h) [reset = 0h]

EESRH is shown in Figure 11-143 and described in Table 11-130.
The event enable registers (EER/EERH) cannot be modified by directly writing to them. The intent is to
ease the software burden for the case where multiple tasks are attempting to simultaneously modify these
registers. The event enable set registers (EESR/EESRH) are used to enable events. Writes of 1 to the bits
in EESR/EESRH set the corresponding event bits in EER/EERH; writes of 0 have no effect. This register

high (EERH) is set (En= 1).


#### 11.4.1.105 SER Register (offset = 1038h) [reset = 0h]

SER is shown in Figure 11-144 and described in Table 11-131.
The secondary event registers (SER/SERH) provide information on the state of a DMA channel or event
(0 through 63). If the EDMA3CC receives a TR synchronization due to a manual-trigger, event-trigger, or
chained-trigger source (ESR.En/ESRH.En= 1, ER.En/ERH.En= 1, or CER.En/CERH.En= 1), which results
in the setting of a corresponding event bit in SER/SERH (SER.En/SERH.En = 1), it implies that the
corresponding DMA event is in the queue. Once a bit corresponding to an event is set in SER/SERH, the
EDMA3CC does not prioritize additional events on the same DMA channel. Depending on the condition
that lead to the setting of the SER bits, either the EDMA3CC hardware or the software (using
SECR/SECRH) needs to clear the SER/SERH bits for the EDMA3CC to evaluate subsequent events
(subsequent transfers) on the same channel. For additional conditions that can cause the secondary event
registers to be set, see EDMA Overview. This register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64
DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels consist of a set of registers (with exception of DMAQNUMn) that
each have 64 bits and the bit position of each register matches the DMA channel number. Each register is
named with the format reg_name that corresponds to DMA channels 0 through 31 and reg_name_High
that corresponds to DMA channels 32 through 64. For example, the event register (ER) corresponds to

#### 11.4.1.106 SERH Register (offset = 103Ch) [reset = 0h]

SERH is shown in Figure 11-145 and described in Table 11-132.
The secondary event registers (SER/SERH) provide information on the state of a DMA channel or event
(0 through 63). If the EDMA3CC receives a TR synchronization due to a manual-trigger, event-trigger, or
chained-trigger source (ESR.En/ESRH.En= 1, ER.En/ERH.En= 1, or CER.En/CERH.En= 1), which results

#### 11.4.1.107 SECR Register (offset = 1040h) [reset = 0h]

SECR is shown in Figure 11-146 and described in Table 11-133.
The secondary event clear registers (SECR/SECRH) clear the status of the secondary event registers
(SER/SERH). CPU writes of 1 clear the corresponding set bits in SER/SERH. Writes of 0 have no effect.
This register is part of a set of registers that pertain to the 64 DMA channels. The 64 DMA channels

through 64. For example, the event register (ER) corresponds to DMA channel 0 through 31 and the event
register high register (ERH) corresponds to DMA channel 32 through 63. The register is typically called
the event register. The DMA channel registers are accessible via read/writes to the global address range.
They are also accessible via read/writes to the shadow address range. The read/write ability to the
registers in the shadow region are controlled by the DMA region access registers (DRAEm/DRAEHm).

#### 11.4.1.109 IER Register (offset = 1050h) [reset = 0h]

IER is shown in Figure 11-148 and described in Table 11-135.
Interrupt enable registers (IER/IERH) are used to enable/disable the transfer completion interrupt
generation by the EDMA3CC for all DMA/QDMA channels. The IER/IERH cannot be written to directly. To
set any interrupt bit in IER/IERH, a 1 must be written to the corresponding interrupt bit in the interrupt
enable set registers (IESR/IESRH). Similarly, to clear any interrupt bit in IER/IERH, a 1 must be written to
the corresponding interrupt bit in the interrupt enable clear registers (IECR/IECRH). All DMA/QDMA
channels can be set to assert an EDMA3CC completion interrupt to the CPU on transfer completion, by
appropriately configuring the PaRAM entry associated with the channels. This register is used for the
transfer completion interrupt reporting/generating by the EDMA3CC. For more details on EDMA3CC
completion interrupt generation, see EDMA3 Interrupts.

#### 11.4.1.115 IPR Register (offset = 1068h) [reset = 0h]

IPR is shown in Figure 11-154 and described in Table 11-141.
If the TCINTEN and/or ITCINTEN bit in the channel option parameter (OPT) is set in the PaRAM entry
associated with the channel (DMA or QDMA), then the EDMA3TC (for normal completion) or the
EDMA3CC (for early completion) returns a completion code on transfer or intermediate transfer
completion. The value of the returned completion code is equal to the TCC bit in OPT for the PaRAM
entry associated with the channel. When an interrupt transfer completion code with TCC = n is detected
by the EDMA3CC, then the corresponding bit is set in the interrupt pending register (IPR.In, if n = 0 to 31;
IPRH.In, if n = 32 to 63). Note that once a bit is set in the interrupt pending registers, it remains set; it is
your responsibility to clear these bits. The bits set in IPR/IPRH are cleared by writing a 1 to the
corresponding bits in the interrupt clear registers (ICR/ICRH). All DMA/QDMA channels can be set to
assert an EDMA3CC completion interrupt to the CPU on transfer completion, by appropriately configuring
the PaRAM entry associated with the channels. This register is used for the transfer completion interrupt
reporting/generating by the EDMA3CC. For more details on EDMA3CC completion interrupt generation,

#### 11.4.1.116 IPRH Register (offset = 106Ch) [reset = 0h]

IPRH is shown in Figure 11-155 and described in Table 11-142.
If the TCINTEN and/or ITCINTEN bit in the channel option parameter (OPT) is set in the PaRAM entry
associated with the channel (DMA or QDMA), then the EDMA3TC (for normal completion) or the
EDMA3CC (for early completion) returns a completion code on transfer or intermediate transfer
completion. The value of the returned completion code is equal to the TCC bit in OPT for the PaRAM
entry associated with the channel. When an interrupt transfer completion code with TCC = n is detected
by the EDMA3CC, then the corresponding bit is set in the interrupt pending register (IPR.In, if n = 0 to 31;
IPRH.In, if n = 32 to 63). Note that once a bit is set in the interrupt pending registers, it remains set; it is
your responsibility to clear these bits. The bits set in IPR/IPRH are cleared by writing a 1 to the
corresponding bits in the interrupt clear registers (ICR/ICRH). All DMA/QDMA channels can be set to
assert an EDMA3CC completion interrupt to the CPU on transfer completion, by appropriately configuring
the PaRAM entry associated with the channels. This register is used for the transfer completion interrupt

#### 11.4.1.119 IEVAL Register (offset = 1078h) [reset = 0h]

IEVAL is shown in Figure 11-158 and described in Table 11-145.
The interrupt evaluate register (IEVAL) is the only register that physically exists in both the global region
and the shadow regions. In other words, the read/write accessibility for the shadow region IEVAL is not
affected by the DMA/QDMA region access registers (DRAEm/DRAEHm, QRAEn/QRAEHn). IEVAL is
needed for robust ISR operations to ensure that interrupts are not missed by the CPU. All DMA/QDMA
channels can be set to assert an EDMA3CC completion interrupt to the CPU on transfer completion, by
appropriately configuring the PaRAM entry associated with the channels. This register is used for the
transfer completion interrupt reporting/generating by the EDMA3CC. For more details on EDMA3CC
completion interrupt generation, see EDMA3 Interrupts.

The EDMA3CC completion interrupt that is pulsed depends on which
IEVAL is being exercised.
For example, writing to the EVAL bit in IEVAL pulses the global
completion interrupt, but writing to the EVAL bit in IEVAL0 pulses the
region 0 completion interrupt.
0h = No effect.
1h = Causes EDMA3CC completion interrupt to be pulsed, if any
enabled (IERn/IERHn = 1) interrupts are still pending (IPRn/IPRHn =
1).


#### 11.4.1.120 QER Register (offset = 1080h) [reset = 0h]

QER is shown in Figure 11-159 and described in Table 11-146.
The QDMA event register (QER) channel n bit is set (En = 1) when the CPU or any EDMA3 programmer
(including EDMA3) performs a write to the trigger word (using the QDMA channel mapping register
(QCHMAPn)) in the PaRAM entry associated with QDMA channel n (which is also programmed using
QCHMAPn). The En bit is also set when the EDMA3CC performs a link update on a PaRAM address that
matches the QCHMAPn settings. The QDMA event is latched only if the QDMA event enable register
(QEER) channel n bit is also enabled (QEER.En = 1). Once a bit is set in QER, then the corresponding
QDMA event (auto-trigger) is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request
submission to the transfer controllers. For additional conditions that can lead to the setting of QER bits,
see EDMA Overview. The setting of an event is a higher priority relative to clear operations (via
hardware). If set and clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition wins. If the event was
previously set, then the QDMA event missed register (QEMR) would be set because an event is lost. If the
event was previously clear, then the event remains set and is prioritized for submission to the event
queues. The set bits in QER are only cleared when the transfer request associated with the corresponding
channels has been processed by the EDMA3CC and submitted to the transfer controller. If the En bit is
already set and a QDMA event for the same QDMA channel occurs prior to the original being cleared,
then the second missed event is latched in QEMR (En = 1). QER is part of a set of register that control the
QDMA channels in EDMA3CC. QDMA channels (with the exception of the QDMA queue number register)
consist of a set of registers, each of which have a bit location. Each bit position corresponds to a QDMA
channel number. The QDMA channel registers are accessible via read/writes to the global address range.
They are also accessible via read/writes to the shadow address range. The read/write accessibility in the
shadow region address region is controlled by the QDMA region access registers (QRAEn/QRAEHn).

#### 11.4.1.121 QEER Register (offset = 1084h) [reset = 0h]

QEER is shown in Figure 11-160 and described in Table 11-147.
The EDMA3CC provides the option of selectively enabling/disabling each channel in the QDMA event
register (QER) by using the QDMA event enable register (QEER). If any of the event bits in QEER is set
(using the QDMA event enable set register, QEESR), it will enable that corresponding event. Alternatively,
if any event bit in QEER is cleared (using the QDMA event enable clear register, QEECR), it will disable
the corresponding QDMA channel. The QDMA event register will not latch any event for a QDMA channel,
if it is not enabled via QEER. QEER is part of a set of register that control the QDMA channels in
EDMA3CC. QDMA channels (with the exception of the QDMA queue number register) consist of a set of
registers, each of which have a bit location. Each bit position corresponds to a QDMA channel number.
The QDMA channel registers are accessible via read/writes to the global address range. They are also
accessible via read/writes to the shadow address range. The read/write accessibility in the shadow region
address region is controlled by the QDMA region access registers (QRAEn/QRAEHn).

0h = QDMA channel n is not enabled. QDMA event will not be
recognized and will not latch in the QDMA event register (QER).
1h = QDMA channel n is enabled. QDMA events will be recognized
and will get latched in the QDMA event register (QER).


#### 11.4.1.122 QEECR Register (offset = 1088h) [reset = 0h]

QEECR is shown in Figure 11-161 and described in Table 11-148.
The QDMA event enable register (QEER) cannot be modified by directly writing to the register, to ease the
software burden when multiple tasks are attempting to simultaneously modify these registers. The QDMA
event enable clear register (QEECR) is used to disable events. Writes of 1 to the bits in QEECR clear the
corresponding QDMA channel bits in QEER; writes of 0 have no effect. QEECR is part of a set of register
that control the QDMA channels in EDMA3CC. QDMA channels (with the exception of the QDMA queue
number register) consist of a set of registers, each of which have a bit location. Each bit position
corresponds to a QDMA channel number. The QDMA channel registers are accessible via read/writes to
the global address range. They are also accessible via read/writes to the shadow address range. The
read/write accessibility in the shadow region address region is controlled by the QDMA region access
registers (QRAEn/QRAEHn).

#### 11.4.1.123 QEESR Register (offset = 108Ch) [reset = 0h]

QEESR is shown in Figure 11-162 and described in Table 11-149.
The QDMA event enable register (QEER) cannot be modified by directly writing to the register, to ease the
software burden when multiple tasks are attempting to simultaneously modify these registers. The QDMA
event enable set register (QEESR) is used to enable events. Writes of 1 to the bits in QEESR set the
corresponding QDMA channel bits in QEER; writes of 0 have no effect.

0h = No effect.
1h = QDMA event is enabled. Corresponding bit in the QDMA event
enable register (QEER) is set (En = 1).


#### 11.4.1.124 QSER Register (offset = 1090h) [reset = 0h]

QSER is shown in Figure 11-163 and described in Table 11-150.
The QDMA secondary event register (QSER) provides information on the state of a QDMA event. If at any
time a bit corresponding to a QDMA channel is set in QSER, that implies that the corresponding QDMA
event is in the queue. Once a bit corresponding to a QDMA channel is set in QSER, the EDMA3CC does
not prioritize additional events on the same QDMA channel. Depending on the condition that lead to the
setting of the QSER bits, either the EDMA3CC hardware or the software (using QSECR) needs to clear
the QSER bits for the EDMA3CC to evaluate subsequent QDMA events on the channel. Based on
whether the associated TR request is valid, or it is a null or dummy TR, the implications on the state of
QSER and the required user actions to submit another QDMA transfer might be different. For additional
conditions that can cause the secondary event registers (QSER\SER) to be set, see EDMA Overview.
QSER is part of a set of register that control the QDMA channels in EDMA3CC. QDMA channels (with the
exception of the QDMA queue number register) consist of a set of registers, each of which have a bit
location. Each bit position corresponds to a QDMA channel number. The QDMA channel registers are
accessible via read/writes to the global address range. They are also accessible via read/writes to the
shadow address range. The read/write accessibility in the shadow region address region is controlled by
the QDMA region access registers (QRAEn/QRAEHn).

0h = QDMA event is not currently stored in the event queue.
1h = QDMA event is currently stored in the event queue. EDMA3CC
will not prioritize additional events.


#### 11.4.1.125 QSECR Register (offset = 1094h) [reset = 0h]

QSECR is shown in Figure 11-164 and described in Table 11-151.
The QDMA secondary event clear register (QSECR) clears the status of the QDMA secondary event
register (QSER) and the QDMA event register (QER). CPU writes of 1 clear the corresponding set bits in
QSER and QER. Writes of 0 have no effect. Note that this differs from the secondary event clear register
(SECR) operation, which only clears the secondary event register (SER) bits and does not affect the event
registers. QESCR is part of a set of register that control the QDMA channels in EDMA3CC. QDMA
channels (with the exception of the QDMA queue number register) consist of a set of registers, each of
which have a bit location. Each bit position corresponds to a QDMA channel number. The QDMA channel
registers are accessible via read/writes to the global address range. They are also accessible via
read/writes to the shadow address range. The read/write accessibility in the shadow region address region
is controlled by the QDMA region access registers (QRAEn/QRAEHn).

#### 11.4.2.10 RDRATE Register (offset = 140h) [reset = 0h]

RDRATE is shown in Figure 11-174 and described in Table 11-162.
The EDMA3 transfer controller issues read commands at a rate controlled by the read rate register
(RDRATE). The RDRATE defines the number of idle cycles that the read controller must wait before
issuing subsequent commands. This applies both to commands within a transfer request packet (TRP)
and for commands that are issued for different transfer requests (TRs). For instance, if RDRATE is set to
4 cycles between reads, there are 3 inactive cycles between reads. RDRATE allows flexibility in transfer
controller access requests to an endpoint. For an application, RDRATE can be manipulated to slow down
the access rate, so that the endpoint may service requests from other masters during the inactive
EDMA3TC cycles. Note: The RDRATE value for a transfer controller is expected to be static, as it is
decided based on the application requirement. It is not recommended to change the RDRATE value on
the fly.

#### 11.4.2.28 DFMPPRXY0 Register (offset = 314h) [reset = 0h]

DFMPPRXY0 is shown in Figure 11-192 and described in Table 11-180.
The Destination FIFO Memory Protection Proxy Register (DFMPPRXY) is an EDMA3TC channel register.
This EDMA3TC channel register is part of the Destination Register FIFO Register Set. It is read-only and
provided to facilitate debugging by providing a window into how the transfer controller (TC) was
programmed by the channel controller (CC), as well as showing status of the transfer controller (TC)
during a transfer. The number of destination FIFO register sets depends on the destination FIFO depth.
TC0, TC1, and TC2 each have a destination FIFO depth of 4, so there are four sets of destination FIFO
registers for each of these transfer controllers.

DFMPPRXY1 is shown in Figure 11-198 and described in Table 11-186.
The Destination FIFO Memory Protection Proxy Register (DFMPPRXY) is an EDMA3TC channel register.
This EDMA3TC channel register is part of the Destination Register FIFO Register Set. It is read-only and
provided to facilitate debugging by providing a window into how the transfer controller (TC) was
programmed by the channel controller (CC), as well as showing status of the transfer controller (TC)
during a transfer. The number of destination FIFO register sets depends on the destination FIFO depth.
TC0, TC1, and TC2 each have a destination FIFO depth of 4, so there are four sets of destination FIFO
registers for each of these transfer controllers.

#### 11.4.2.35 DFOPT2 Register (offset = 380h) [reset = 0h]

DFOPT2 is shown in Figure 11-199 and described in Table 11-187.
The Destination FIFO Options Register (DFOPT) is an EDMA3TC channel register. This EDMA3TC
channel register is part of the Destination Register FIFO Register Set. It is read-only and provided to
facilitate debugging by providing a window into how the transfer controller (TC) was programmed by the
channel controller (CC), as well as showing status of the transfer controller (TC) during a transfer. The
number of destination FIFO register sets depends on the destination FIFO depth. TC0, TC1, and TC2
each have a destination FIFO depth of 4, so there are four sets of destination FIFO registers for each of
these transfer controllers.

#### 11.4.2.41 DFOPT3 Register (offset = 3C0h) [reset = 0h]

DFOPT3 is shown in Figure 11-205 and described in Table 11-193.
The Destination FIFO Options Register (DFOPT) is an EDMA3TC channel register. This EDMA3TC
channel register is part of the Destination Register FIFO Register Set. It is read-only and provided to
facilitate debugging by providing a window into how the transfer controller (TC) was programmed by the
channel controller (CC), as well as showing status of the transfer controller (TC) during a transfer. The
number of destination FIFO register sets depends on the destination FIFO depth. TC0, TC1, and TC2
each have a destination FIFO depth of 4, so there are four sets of destination FIFO registers for each of
these transfer controllers.

Registers (ER/ERH), make sure that the event is enabled in the Event Enable
Registers (EER/EERH). Similarly, for QDMA channels, make sure that QDMA events
are appropriately enabled in the QDMA Event Enable Register (QEER).
2) Verify that the DMA or QDMA Secondary Event Register (SER/SERH/QSERH) bits

occur on a channel.                         typical in two cases:
1) QDMA channels: Typically if the parameter set is non-static and expected to be
terminated by a NULL set (i.e., OPT.STATIC = 0, LINK = 0xFFFF), the parameter set is
updated with a NULL set after submission of the last TR. Because QDMA channels are
auto-triggered, this update caused the generation of an event. An event generated for a
NULL set causes an error condition and results in setting the bits corresponding to the
QDMA channel in the QEMR and QSER. This will disable further prioritization of the
channel.
2) DMA channels used in a continuous mode: The peripheral may be set up to
continuously generate infinite events (for instance, in case of McASP, every time the
data shifts out from the DXR register, it generates an XEVT). The parameter set may
be programmed to expect only a finite number of events and to be terminated by a
NULL link. After the expected number of events, the parameter set is reloaded with a
NULL parameter set. Because the peripheral will generate additional events, an error
condition is set in the SER.Ex and EMR.Ex set, preventing further event prioritization.
You must ensure that the number of events received is limited to the expected number
of events for which the parameter set is programmed, or you must ensure that bits
corresponding to particular channel or event are not set in the Secondary event
registers (SER/SERH/QSER) and Event Missed Registers (EMR/EMRH/QEMR) before
trying to perform subsequent transfers for the event/channel.
Completion interrupts are not asserted, or You must ensure the following:
no further interrupts are received after the 1) The interrupt generation is enabled in the OPT of the associated PaRAM set
first completion interrupt.                  (TCINTEN = 1 and/or ITCINTEN = 1).
2) The interrupts are enabled in the EDMA3 Channel Controller, via the Interrupt
Enable Registers (IER/IERH).
3) The corresponding interrupts are enabled in the device interrupt controller.
4) The set interrupts are cleared in the interrupt pending registers (IPR/IPRH) before
exiting the transfer completion interrupt service routine (ISR). See Section 11.3.9.1.2
for details on writing EDMA3 ISRs.
5) If working with shadow region interrupts, make sure that the DMA Region Access
registers (DRAE/DRAEH) are set up properly, because the DRAE/DRAEH registers act
as secondary enables for shadow region completion interrupts, along with the
IER/IERH registers.
If working with shadow region interrupts, make sure that the bits corresponding to the
transfer completion code (TCC) value are also enabled in the DRAE/DRAEH registers.
For instance, if the PaRAM set associated with Channel 0 returns a completion code of
63 (OPT.TCC=63), ensure that DRAEH.E63 is also set for a shadow region completion
interrupt because the interrupt pending register bit set will be IPRH.I63 (not IPR.I0).


### 11.5.2 Miscellaneous Programming/Debug Tips

1. For several registers, the setting and clearing of bits needs to be done via separate dedicated
registers. For example, the Event Register (ER/ERH) can only be cleared by writing a 1 to the
corresponding bits in the Event Clear Registers (ECR/ECRH). Similarly, the Event Enable Register
(EER/EERH) bits can only be set with writes of 1 to the Event Enable Set Registers (EESR/EESRH)
and cleared with writes of 1 to the corresponding bits in the Event Enable Clear Register
(EECR/EECRH).
2. Writes to the shadow region memory maps are governed by region access registers
(DRAE/DRAEH/QRAE). If the appropriate channels are not enabled in these registers, read/write
access to the shadow region memory map is not enabled.
3. When working with shadow region completion interrupts, ensure that the DMA Region Access
Registers (DRAE/DRAEH) for every region are set in a mutually exclusive way (unless it is a
requirement for an application). If there is an overlap in the allocated channels and transfer completion
codes (setting of Interrupt Pending Register bits) in the region resource allocation, it results in multiple


shadow region completion interrupts. For example, if DRAE0.E0 and DRAE1.E0 are both set, then on
completion of a transfer that returns a TCC=0, they will generate both shadow region 0 and 1
completion interrupts.
4. While programming a non-dummy parameter set, ensure the CCNT is not left to zero.
5. Enable the EDMA3CC error interrupt in the device controller and attach an interrupt service routine
(ISR) to ensure that error conditions are not missed in an application and are appropriately addressed
with the ISR.
6. Depending on the application, you may want to break large transfers into smaller transfers and use
self-chaining to prevent starvation of other events in an event queue.
7. In applications where a large transfer is broken into sets of small transfers using chaining or other
methods, you might choose to use the early chaining option to reduce the time between the sets of
transfers and increase the throughput. However, keep in mind that with early completion, all data might
have not been received at the end point when completion is reported because the EDMA3CC internally
signals completion when the TR is submitted to the EDMA3TC, potentially before any data has been
transferred.
8. The event queue entries can be observed to determine the last few events if there is a system failure
(provided the entries were not bypassed).


### 11.5.3 Setting Up a Transfer

The following list provides a quick guide for the typical steps involved in setting up a transfer.
Step 1. Initiating a DMA/QDMA channel
1. Determine the type of channel (QDMA or DMA) to be used.
2. Channel mapping
i. If using a QDMA channel, program the QCHMAP with the parameter set number to
which the channel maps and the trigger word.
ii. If using a DMA channel, program the DCHMAP with the parameter set number to
which the channel maps.
3. If the channel is being used in the context of a shadow region, ensure the DRAE/DRAEH
for the region is properly set up to allow read write accesses to bits in the event registers
and interrupt registers in the Shadow region memory map. The subsequent steps in this
process should be done using the respective shadow region registers. (Shadow region
descriptions and usage are provided in Section 11.3.7.1.)
4. Determine the type of triggering used.
i. If external events are used for triggering (DMA channels), enable the respective
event in EER/EERH by writing into EESR/EESRH.
ii. If QDMA Channel is used, enable the channel in QEER by writing into QEESR.
5. Queue setup
i. If a QDMA channel is used, set up the QDMAQNUM to map the channel to the
respective event queue.
ii. If a DMA channel is used, set up the DMAQNUM to map the event to the respective
event queue.
Step 2. Parameter set setup
1. Program the PaRAM set number associated with the channel. Note that if it is a QDMA
channel, the PaRAM entry that is configured as trigger word is written to last.
Alternatively, enable the QDMA channel (step 1-b-ii above) just before the write to the
trigger word.
See Section 11.3.19 for parameter set field setups for different types of transfers. See the
sections on chaining (Section 11.3.8) and interrupt completion (Section 11.3.9) on how to
set up final/intermediate completion chaining and/or interrupts.
Step 3. Interrupt setup
1. Enable the interrupt in the IER/IERH by writing into IESR/IESRH.
2. Ensure that the EDMA3CC completion interrupt (either the global or the shadow region
interrupt) is enabled properly in the device interrupt controller.
3. Ensure the EDMA3CC completion interrupt (this refers to either the Global interrupt or the
shadow region interrupt) is enabled properly in the Device Interrupt controller.
4. Set up the interrupt controller properly to receive the expected EDMA3 interrupt.


Step 4.   Initiate transfer
1. This step is highly dependent on the event trigger source:
i. If the source is an external event coming from a peripheral, the peripheral will be
enabled to start generating relevant EDMA3 events that can be latched to the ER
transfer.
ii. For QDMA events, writes to the trigger word (step 2-a above) will initiate the transfer.
iii. Manually triggered transfers will be initiated by writes to the Event Set Registers
(ESR/ESRH).
iv. Chained-trigger events initiate when a previous transfer returns a transfer completion
code equal to the chained channel number.
Step 5.   Wait for completion
1. If the interrupts are enabled as mentioned in step 3 above, then the EDMA3CC will
generate a completion interrupt to the CPU whenever transfer completion results in
setting the corresponding bits in the interrupt pending register (IPR/IPRH). The set bits
must be cleared in the IPR\IPRH by writing to corresponding bit in ICR\ICRH.
2. If polling for completion (interrupts not enabled in the device controller), then the
application code can wait on the expected bits to be set in the IPR\IPRH. Again, the set
bits in the IPR\IPRH must be manually cleared via ICR\ICRH before the next set of
transfers is performed for the same transfer completion code values.
